Users Are Not Adding Quality
Connections During Onboarding
TL;DR
Our onboarding process is not helping users find quality connections: 42% users
added no adult connections during onboarding, and 17% of the new users added zero
adult or kid contacts during onboarding and land in the inbox with no connection other
than their parents.
â€¢ Suggestion-based connections added are low quality: over two thirds contacts
added during onboarding do not lead to a WAT in 7 days, and close to 90% of the
contacts shown are irrelevant.
User without connections from onboarding churn early: 30% of them were only
active in the first week, and 40% are no longer MAU by Day 45. Helping these users find
value can lead to a net gain of 10K US MAU per month.
We have an opportunity here to improve the contact-selection experience for new
users: rethinking about how to recommend and how to expand the contact inventory
We can explicitly uprank inviter/inviters' kids and allow parents to search for
non-FB friends' kids during onboarding.
We can encourage parents to find and search for an adult contact for their kid to
chat with, instead of recommending the parents' FB friends
The key here is to address the mismatch between parents' and kids' graph.
