Addressing Cold Start During Onboarding
For new users, If we believe that one of the main goals of onboarding should be helping users
discover quality connections, then surfacing quality connections during onboarding is key.
Assuming that we don't completely change the onboarding flow for suggested contacts, how do
we ensure that users have the right setup from the get-go?

Explicitly Uprank Inviter/Inviter Kids + Let Parents Search for
Non-FB Friends' Kids During Onboarding
Context:
Current "Add Kids" page will only show MK kids of the source parents' FB friends, which means
that new MK parents will have a hard time finding the kids of their inviters' kids (if they have
been invited on the FB platform before) unless they are already FB friends with the target
parent.
Redacted for Congress
Suggestion:
1) We figure out a way to uprank the original inviters' kids in the recommend list (if the new
user received an invite in the past), regardless of whether or not the source and target
parents are FB friends.
2) We incorporate search to allow new parents to search for a specific kid and nudge them
to do so, especially if the new users were invited offline (in the case that we don't have
data linking the inviter and invitee). Note here that compared to pre-Covid era,
Option (2) might be subject to privacy concerns, but it is the best alternative for source parents
to find a potential quality kid connection in the most common "BFF scenarios" (kids are best
friends, parents are not FB friends).
