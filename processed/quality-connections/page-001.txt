Users Are Not Adding Quality Connections During Onboarding
From New User Journey UXR studies, we have seen that our contact-selection process during
onboarding does not set new users up for success, and users with few connections from
onboarding churn early.
TL;DR:
• Our onboarding process is not helping users find quality connections: 42% users added
no adult connections during onboarding, and 18% of the new users added zero adult or kid
contacts during onboarding and land in the inbox with no connection other than their
parents.
• Suggestion-based connections added during onboarding are low quality: over two thirds
contacts added during onboarding do not lead to a WAT in 7 days, and close to 90% of the
contacts shown during onboarding are irrelevant.
Redacted for Congress
• User without connections from onboarding churn early: 30% of them were only active in
the first week, and 40% are no longer MAU by Day 45. Helping these users find value can
lead to a net gain of 10K US MAU per month.
• We have an opportunity here to improve the contact-selection experience for new users:
it's time to start rethinking about how to recommend and how to expand the contact
inventory during onboarding.
