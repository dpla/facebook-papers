The table shows that for the 42% users did not find any relevant adults to add during
onboarding, and this is most likely because the suggested adult contacts consist primarily of the
parents' close FB friends. Quality adult connections for a kid user are likely a family member
(grandpas, grandmas, older cousins etc), but they are either not on FB yet or somehow not
surfaced during onboarding.

What's even more concerning is that about 25% users did not add any kid connections during
onboarding. It is possible that these are younger kids without many established kid connections
already on MK or users who are coming to the MK organically, so the cold start problem for
these users are even worse.
