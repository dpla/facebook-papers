that's interesting, but i'm assuming that would be very hard when it
comes to friend suggestions. What makes a "good candidate friend" has
nothing to do with your interests, but everything to do with your actual IRL
social graph, which we have much fewer signals to start with (cold start
friending problem).
That's the main reason we rely on the parent graph as a major signal to start
with right?
That said, I don't remember, if a user was invited to the app, do we use the
inviter kid's kid-graph as a big signal in ranking the invitee's contact
suggestions? (Not just uprank the inviter/invitee, but actually use inviter's kid
graph signals for invitee's ranking)

Yeah I agree it's a hard problem to solve. Applying the Netflix approach to MK
will mean asking the users who they want to chat aka getting signals from
them (not what their interests are, sorry if the comment above was a bit
confusing) with during onboarding. e.g. ask the parents if they want their kids
to chat with: grandparents, cousins, school friends, etc.
do you know if we are allowed to use the inviter's kid's graph as
signals for contact suggestions for the invitee?

Sadly not, we are not allowed to use any kid related features for
invites ranking
