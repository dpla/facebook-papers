What is "onboarding?"
Most commonly, we use the word "onboarding‚Äù to refer to account creation to account activation
flow. "Account creation" occurs when the parent creates a new kid account (on either PD on the
FB app, or on the MK app), and "account activation" occurs when the kid lands in the inbox (see
the thread tiles) and becomes a MAU for the remainder of that month.
There are four main goals of the current onboarding flow that the users can take:
1. Parent: basic info (name, birthday, add a photo)
1. Parent: choose contacts:
a. "Choose kid to chat with" (add another kid, then Parent B needs to approve; if
with the same creator aka sibling kids, then automatically added)
b. "Finds parents of their friends to chat with" (FB-MK parents not shown)
C. "Choose adult to chat with" (Parent A's FB friends, automatically added, less
engagement)
2. Parent: opt-ins
a. FoF opt-in
b. SF opt-in
C. CMC opt-in
d. KC opt-in
3. Kid:
a. Agree with the guideline
b. Take a picture
c. Go through the four-part onboarding
d. Land in inbox
