For some time period before we launched Privacy Policy v2, Growth retention
focused on conversation starters (since we wanted to do connections work
after privacy policy updated).
Encouraging friends of new users to send them a sticker improved WAP by
+1.2878+0.9468% 3 weeks after the experiment ended:

When friends of new users have DGG (Draw-Guess-Game), WAP of the new
users improved by +0.9510+0.5619
(That being said, when new users have DGG, it actually hurts their WAP)

So yeah, the answer is that conversation starters can definitely help; but I
that connections is certainly the bigger lever and elephant in
the room.
That being said, in 2018, we also worked heavily on Connections, and we
added a TON of connections without moving overall WAT. That led to an org-
wide pivot away from connections work toward WAT, since we didn't believe
our work was adding high-quality connection (partly validated again by our
research and
data analysis here).
During that period of time, we focused almost exclusively on parent's FB
graph (well, since that was the only thing allowed by privacy policy). I believe
that focus was the cause of the "low quality" connections.
For connections to move retention, I believe we need to go beyond the
parent's FB graph. I am excited to see where FoF can get us. I am also excited
to see how far we can go with some of the other big bets like School which
expands kid's visibility further.
