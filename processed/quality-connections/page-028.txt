From BFF research, we know that parents are aware of their
child's best friends and know about their child's IRL friend graph. Parents do
not add these connections because they are not offered as suggested kid or
adult contacts so then parents make a best guess from the suggested
contacts to guage who their child wants to talk to. I don't think we can say
these connections are high quality from the parent perspective but just a good
faith effort from parents to give their child someone to talk to on MK. I think
the main point to hit home is that these irrelevant connections do not keep
kids on the app and they churn when their friends are not using MK. From the
New User Journey 2nd round interviews, we are seeing that these non-IRL
friend connections do not keep kids on the platform. Kids keep telling I would
use the app more if my friends were on it.
FYI - Parents think adding contacts at onboarding is the most efficient way to
add contacts for their child. They struggle to figure out how add friends for
their child post-onboarding. CC:

Sorry for arriving late to the party here. Onboarding tries to solve two problems:
high intent friending and low/medium intent friending. We're not doing a great job
with either.
High Intent: search is key. If they already know who they want to add, but we're
having them go through a huge list, that's not very motivating. Especially if they
can't find that specific person.
Low intent: what makes it particularly hard here is that we can't use FoF in its pure
form because the kid has no friends yet. We could increase the candidate set even
more here by allowed friends of friends through the parent graph, but these are
probably going to be even lower quality.
