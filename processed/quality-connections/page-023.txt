I'm also curious to learn what the data "tradeoffs" in experience are for things we
believe are "low quality". While there's obvious user quality / experience
degradations for connecting "low quality" connections, does that interfere or come
at the cost of something?

Curious about two things:
1) How are high quality connections found now? Kid Codes? Does that happen in
the first week? Do we find evidence that kids need any "placeholder" connections
besides the parent between the time of account creator and the first high quality
connection?
2) If high quality connection is defined as WAT in the first 7 days, have we looked
into prompts for WAT? Meaning conversation starters, games, question off the day,
etc

2) We are explicitely guarding against doing that on the
connection side. We are using it a a signal. But working too close to the metric
would be gaming it here.
1) Kid Codes generates the highest value connections, but only a small share
of our users use them.
1) Agree that ideally onboarding connections who be a placeholder until they
get more high value connections. In practice it is the only connections some of
our users. We need to grow our connections outside of onboarding so we
don't depend on these onboarding connections as much. See
