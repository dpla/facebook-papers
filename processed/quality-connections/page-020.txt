We have played around many different variations on Invite and Contact lists in
onboarding in the past (some with suggestions, some without suggestions) ie
Forced Search that can also add some color to this.
iirc, while suggestions might have a lot of room for improvement, they still
performed much better compared to not having them when it came to finding
contacts to establish in the first place. cc Lin
I totally agree on needing to satisfy high-intent cases, but that doesn't mean there
isn't value in suggestions either.

Thanks and that's a good context to keep in mind.
Some potentially controversial take on this "recommendation/suggestion"
topic:
suggestions yield the highest value when we have data to know what we
should recommend. For many apps, this means asking a question on what the
user want during onboarding ("pick three genres of music or types of book
you're interested", or Netflix "tell us what you like to watch"). Compared other
apps' approach with MK's approach, we might be a bit too confident on what
we can recommend to new users.
Having more of a hybrid approach and asking users what they want from the
start might help us in the long-run and result in the highest impact in
retention. Maybe that's something we can keep in mind if we were to redesign
the onboarding flow in the future.
