Are the data specific to MK onboarding or PD onboarding is also included?
18% of the new users added zero adult or kid contacts during onboarding and
land in the inbox with no connection other than their parents
Wondering how many of the 18% are likely adults(https://fburl.com/qk8uznxa)?
Agree there definitely room to improve but just want to make sure we are not
focusing on people such as parents who are just checking out the app

I looked at MK onboarding and excluded the likely adults from the analysis.
Yes - I think for the activation efforts for this half, it also makes sense to only
target those who are more likely to be real kid accounts.
