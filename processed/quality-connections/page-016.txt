Notes on Data Used
1. CTR for suggested contact analysis looks at those who created an account on PD and
went through the onboarding flow on PD (fb_client_event).
a. Suggested contacts (adult and kid) impression events are missing on mk_client
events
2. For the other analyses, we looked at users who onboarded on the MK device using an
iOS device
a. Created and activated on the same day (to ensure no dropoff and high intent)
b. Between 12/01/2020 - 01/31/2021
c. Excluding likely "adult" MK accounts (thanks for the analysis on possible
Adult MK accounts)
d. MK4A and Kindle logging of the MK events are missing the target_id (for
requests sent info) for the connection requests sent during onboarding.
