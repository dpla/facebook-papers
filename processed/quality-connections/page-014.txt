How the "add” friending works during onboarding
Before the opt-in screens, parent users go through one "invites" screen and two “friending"
screens to add relevant contacts for their kids (screenshots below).
Suggested Kid Contacts: Kid users with the same account creator (such as siblings) are
automatically added, whereas sending a request to other kids will need to target kids' parental
approval.
Suggested Parent Contacts: Parent contact suggestions are only of the parent user's Facebook
friends, and the target will be automatically added and show up in the kids' inbox.

Find Natalia's Friends by Sending an
Invite to Their Parents
You don't need to be Facebook friends with
a parent to invite them. They'll be able to see
Natalia's name and photo.
When you add someone, their parent or
guardian will see Natalie's name and photo
and needs to approve the request before
your children can chat.
