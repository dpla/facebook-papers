For high-reward, low-cost suggestion forms like friending that may often not yield
with every suggestion being super valuable, it's more important to err on the side of
having too many false-positives to guarantee chances of capturing as many true-
positives. That said, the cost of "wrong suggestions" for MK may be different if we
have a lot of fake accounts / adult accounts labeled as kids, which can degrade trust
significantly.cc

totally agree with the point on "relevance" and want to
highlight that the the definition of "quality" for should be a fluid one and CTR
is by no means a perfect proxy for suggestion quality. However, because we
are seeing this link between quality connection --> retained users --> MAU,
WAT becomes a component of that definition.
PYMK might be the closest example here, but we should still bear in mind the
differences between MK and FB/MSGR for the purpose of the comparison:
adults have a much bigger graph and broader definition for "relevant" friends
that they should add. On the contrary, kids have a much smaller circle and and
thus the threshold for what can even be recommended should be higher as a
result.
