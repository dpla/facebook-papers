10% CTR Means That 90% of the Suggested Contacts are
Potentially Irrelevant
We are showing too many suggested contacts than users wish to add: among the 152K users
we looked at who joined MK recently, the CTR for suggested contacts on both the "Friends and
Family" and "Kids" friending page is only fairly low: for adults, the average CTR is 13%, and for
kid, 12%.

As a standard smartphone screen shows around 8-9 candidates on one screen without
scrolling, the aforementioned CTR translates to roughly 1 user on every screen as
relevant/worth adding. Here, CTR is used as a proxy measurement for suggestion quality (see
more below for using connections with WAT as a measure for contact quality). While we do not
have a benchmark for what constitutes an â€œideal" CTR for suggested contacts in the MK
onboarding use case, we risk at losing new MK parents' trust if we suggest the "wrong" contact
(which is very different from me sitting at home and scrolling through a long list of recommended
restaurants to order from on Doordash).

1 in 6 Users Added No Connections During Onboarding
UXR research shows that in general, parents are finding 0-5 "relevant" contacts during
onboarding. Data estimates that around 17% of the activated accounts did not send any "add"
requests during onboarding to either the adult suggestions or the kid suggestions, meaning that
these kids will land in their inbox with zero connections other than their parents. Further
breakdown shows that close to half (42%) did not "add" any adult users during onboarding.
