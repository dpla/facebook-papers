Discussion Points
We would like to end this note with some philosophical questions around onboarding and what
we want the users to get out of onboarding:
1. For those coming to the app for the first time, how do we balance high-intent and
low-intent friending/invites?
a. We know that kids' graphs are different from their parents, so how can we help
surface better connections?
b. Do we/should we recommend so many adult connections?
2. Different use cases for different parents, can we personalize the onboarding flow to
match those different use cases?
a. For instance, can we ask
i. Parents to tell us whom they allow their kids to talk to?
ii. Kids to tell us who they want to talk to?
3. Can we make the onboarding process a shared experience between parents and kids so
that more quality connections can be established from Day 0?
