I definitely agree there is value in the suggestions
and in a high intent friending search. Since the data show the most friending
happens at onboarding and is the most time efficient way for parents to add
contacts for their child, I think there is value to get contacts added to the
child's graph to get started but what I'm finding in the qualitative research is
those contacts (mostly adults) are not on the kid's IRL friend graph. After a
month of using the app, they churn from the app without IRL friends. BFF
research shows those IRL friends are from school, church, neighborhood, and
extracurricular activities (e.g., Girl Scouts, dance, soccer). Early insights from
the New User Journey 2nd round of interviews is that users are using the
suggested list to find target parents to invite to the app. The use case is that
parents are already FB friends. The user experience to scroll through a long
list of suggestions is not ideal becauses users are reporting its not organized
in any systematic way. When scrolling through such a long list, target parent
can easily be skipped, so we do need an easier way to add high intent
friending cases (allow parents to filter down the list). If they are not FB friends
with the other parent, the source parent does not initiate friending at all
because of the common misconception you need to FB friends to make a k2k
connection for their child.
Redacted for Congress
How can parents' participation in FB school/parenting groups
be used to leverage higher quality kid suggestions? Would this still be
considered a kid information?
