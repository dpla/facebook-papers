KOAO Kids Are 28% Less Retained on Day 45
Those who are KOAO (no adult or kid added during onboarding) retain significally worse than
their counterparts, with at least one adult or at least one kid added during onboarding. The delta
for retention between the KOAO and K+A+ (having at least one adult add and one kid add during
onboarding) folks are close to 30% by Day 45.
I
At Day 45 (about one month and half since activation), only 64% of the KOAO group remain
MAU, suggesting that these users can churn easily because they have trouble expanding their
network beyond Day 0 of activation.
Looking at the table below, users with low connection networks on day 0 retain much worse
than those who start off with some connections to chat with.
