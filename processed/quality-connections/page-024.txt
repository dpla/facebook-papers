I don't mean trying to game the metric, but more like if we know
that people who have WAT in the first 7 days retain better, should we try to
help them with it? Could they have a problem of not knowing what to talk
about? Or how to get started?

Agree, we definitely should help kids get these conversations
started. The retention gain is probably not as high as from adding the
connection. But it should still have value.
