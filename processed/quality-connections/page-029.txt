probably going to be even lower quality.
At the end of the day, this is a very tricky problem, because High Quality
Connections usually are the ones in which parents are not connected (school for
example), and during Onboarding, parents can only select kids through their graph.
Long term, I think we should focus on:
- Onboarding should nail High Intent Friending. When parents are creating new
accounts, the kids they have in mind should be super easy to find and add.
- Post Onboarding, we need to make high quality suggestions immediately to the
kid, NOT the parent. That will likely happen mostly through School, not FoF. We
should also upsell to kids that they can send a QR code to connect with their best
friend, for High Intent.
In other words, we shouldn't expect to get a ton of high quality connections in
Onboarding itself because they'll be from the parent graph. We should do more post
Onboarding so the kid is empowered to find friends for him/herself.

have we done a funnel analysis on the 40 steps of the onboarding flow itself? where
ppl drop off or seem to get confused? are they sending invites and ppl just not
accepting? etc etc
