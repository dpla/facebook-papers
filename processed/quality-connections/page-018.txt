Fundamentally to solve the inventory problem, we need:
1. Growth! Given our market penetration of -25%, it's highly likely (75%) that your
kid's friends simply aren't using the app.
2. Visibility Expansion. Parents aren't FB friends. We need FoF, School and
potentially other creative solutions.
Those aren't really problems we can solve in onboarding.
Our hands are tied in how much we can do in onboarding.

I would actually disagree here. We highly increased the volume of kids on MK
in the past year (Some parents see 50+ kids in this list). Yes the kids in there
are not ideal. But cousins are in there, friends thru parents. We should make it
easier to find them so that kids can get started on MK.

re: 50+
That's not a valid argument. Having 50+ kids you don't want your kid to talk to
isn't real inventory.
re: cousins and friends thru parents
Yes, that is a good argument. The chance maybe higher than our market
penetration (25%) because of networked growth.
I agree that there are potentials here for search and ranking to be impactful.

Do we still rank the kid suggestions in onboarding? Any ML plans
to work further on the ranking this half?
