MAU Opportunity to Increase the Connection Experience During
Onboarding
If we were to improve the onboarding experience and help the KOAO users find connections
during onboarding, then we will have a much higher chance of retaining them after one month,
with the aim of converting KOAO users to K+A+, who retain 28% better by Day 45..
Redacted for Congress
Every month, 20% of the -270K newly activated users would fall into the KOAO bucket. Based
on the table above, even if we just help 50% of the KOAO users get one connection during
onboarding, we can prevent 19K per month from churning.
