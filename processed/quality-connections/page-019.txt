I did not mean to suggest that either ranking or inventory is broken here, and I
agree that inventory is a problem for surfacing high-quality suggestions (or
just cold start problem for new users). Plus in MK there is often privacy
constraints on whom we can show.
Disagree that our hands are tied during onboarding, and we should give
parents the options to find those targets (if there are any) and not just simply
rely on their FB network to keep recommending potential suggestions.
A separate note on inventory: just because we have (or will have in the future)
a long list of MK users (kid suggestion) or FB users (adult suggestions) does
not mean that we **should** start ranking them and try to decide whom we
think the users might want to talk to. We position ourselves as a safe app
(close network), so unlike recommendations on Netflix or IG (which is more
about exploration and discovery), our value prop should be clear from the
start.

We do and ML is working on connections foundations this half (training K2K
and K2A models), which will impact kid suggestions across all surfaces
beyond onboarding.
