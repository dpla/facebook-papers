We don't know the exact volume at this point, and we think this is going to be incredibly small
Our first stage is to provide visual understanding (and probably improve audio recognition) for such detection system.
At this stage, our focus is not to determine if a video is actually violating or not. Our next stage is going to buy a
classifier which will gather all knowledges that we know about such content and will determine if it is violating, and this
will be the front-line detection for such violating videos, and this effort is led by
team. Note that for all of these
effort, we are tackling live videos. Real Time Integrity Working Group is probably the best place to learn more about our
work in terms of operationalizing live video problems.
For VOD, we are in the discussion with Graphic Violence team to incorporate such signals into their video violence
classifier (cc
We expect this to be done in Q3.

Cool, thanks for additional info! Sounds like I'm jumping the gun & the next step will be to incorporate
these learnings into a violating classifier.

Great write-up! Any chance you could re-attach the Unicorn query link? Looks like it's stale. I'm also
working on collecting egocentric videos (in a different context).
