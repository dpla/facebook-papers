• Our metrics on car-crashing and cock-fighting look suspicious and too good to be
true. We did perform eyeballing result and see a lot of disagreement in terms of
labels. Therefore, we think once we are able to deduplicate properly, we'll have a
better understanding on the model performance, and it will guide us to figure out
how to improve our clip-based model.
• Label taxonomy and concept training
Redacted for Congress
• We learn that our first labeling taxonomy is not granular enough. We only check if
there's a real gun fired in a first person perspective or not. We should think about
including more questions to get better granular labels, and also enable multi-label
selections for our PDO labeling queue.
• Label quality
• As we mentioned above, there were a lot of examples mis-labeled in these main
categories:
• Games video labeled as positive.
• 3rd person perspective is marked as ist person perspective.
. No gun visible but labeled as FPS.
. We've reached out to PDO and we'll work with their team to ensure the quality.
There were quite a lot of problems when we eyeballed FPs and FNs, so it was quite
hard for us to debug the real FPs and FNs in the first iteration.
