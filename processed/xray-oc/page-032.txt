Redacted for Congress
. We would love to acquire data from law enforcement, mainly their bodycam
footage. We've just received the first copies of these from USG. Our team will

Our team's goal for clip-based model is to fill the gap from what our frame-based model
cannot learn, so we'll work on identifying problems that required action recognition together
with vertical teams in Content Integrity.
