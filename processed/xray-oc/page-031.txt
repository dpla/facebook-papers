Acquire clip-level label
• Another main problem with using video-level label for each videos is that we are
missing out a lot of potential good training data. We plan to build a new system that
can smart select clips from videos (loudest clips) and acquire the labels rather than
using its entire video. This way, our training data will be more granular, and the
label is very likely to be more accurate.
Surface signals to all IG traffic
Redacted for Congress
• As part of vio deprecation, AI Video Understanding team has already been working
with IG Well-being team to transition from vio to XRayVideo 2018a. Once this
transition is complete, these concepts will be available to all IG videos (both VOD
and live)
Deprecate carcrashing and cockfighting frame-based concept
. We have been working to deprecate these two concepts to support the deployment
of new XRayOC frame-based model. We have a new candidate model ready, and I'll
share the result in my next note. We have worked with Video Infra team to enable
online A/B testing for all plugins across VUE platform, and we'll be starting to use
this to support all downstream clients in Content Integrity to support a new
deployment of XRayOC video frame-based model.
