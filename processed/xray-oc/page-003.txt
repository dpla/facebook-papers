Data collection
. For carcrashing and cockfighting, we worked with PDO team to get contents enqueued
and labeled using biased sampling from our old frame-based concepts, starting from
mid-February
â€¢ For first-person shooting, data collection was more challenging. Starting from late May
7th, we get labels for contents for FPS. We leverage multiple existing systems on
Facebook systems:

. We collected a number of videos by searching for Facebook Pages with the SERP
console and then scraping the videos from these pages. We searched for relevant
topics such as paintball, airsoft, firearms competition, police bodycam videos, etc.
Using the SERP console to find videos directly did not work very well because only
a small number of results were returned per search. Searching for pages in this
manner was more effective because a page may have tens to hundreds of videos.
o Another resource we used to find videos is IRIS (Integrity Review using Indexing
Service), which leverages the Unicorn search indices. Using IRIS/Unicorn, we can
search directly for videos using keywords for Facebook content and hashtags for
Instagram content. For Facebook videos, we can search specifically for first-
person/GoPro/helmet cam videos. An example of a query we used is
https://fburl.com/unicorn/2tcnwz7h. Each search can return up to 5000 videos,
and this is limited by Unicorn.
