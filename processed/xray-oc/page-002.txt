Historical problems: Towards the end of H1-2018, who worked on violence video
classifier, noticed that we started to observer a lot of carcrashing and cockfighting in
prevalence data. Our team worked with to collect a small set of data and train two
logistic regression concepts in our XRayOC frame-based model. However, the problem
didn't really get solved, as the model either learn to notice the appearance of two
roosters, or just recognize cars. Earlier this year, we did an exercise to label prevalence
data to see how many of them fall into these two categories, and we noticed that this is
still a problem that we need to solve. We think that we can leverage the 3D-
convolutional neural network to capture the action of cockfighting and carcrashing.

â€¢ Chirstchurch incident: We worked with multiple partners (Graphic Violence, AI Video
Understanding, etc), and we realized that we have been missing first-person-shooting
(FPS) detection. We think there's a strong need of developing such concept to support
our Real Time Integrity team with their operational system, so we also decided to train
this concept.
