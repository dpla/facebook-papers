The video sampling strategy is similar as in production: Every 2-seconds, we sample
every other frames, and choose the first 4-frames as the input of the network. Then we
apply video-level label for each iteration.
• The average precisions for carcrashing, cockfighting, and first-person-shooting are:
0.45965177,0.6286166,0.6067463, respectively.

At Content Integrity, once we have a visual concept deployed into production, our problem
teams will consume these signals in the following manner:
• As we mentioned earlier, for every 2 seconds, we classify using 4 frames. Every 10
4
seconds, we aggregate 5 classification scores using max, median, and mean method. We
call this clip-level score.
• For VOD (video-on-demand), we aggregate all clip-level scores again using the three
main aggregation methods, and we call this video-level score. Most clients will consume
this video-level scores into their meta-classifiers, which is a classifier who'll determine if
a content is violating or not for each problems.
