Operationally if the NZ video were uploaded today - is the new model going to flag it automatically for
remove or removal? E.g. does it hit the min thresholds?

This model aims to learn the visual understanding of first-person shooter perspective which all of our computer vision
systems have not been able to capture previously; therefore we are not aiming at enqueuing contents directly using this
concept. There are multiple reasons:
Today, mining for training data is incredibly hard for this concept, and labeling is also very tricky. We have
completed our first iteration about a month ago, and we learned there were a lot of videos like bodycam infront of
cars, so we would have a lot of FPs. We are working on multiple angles to solve this problem from cleaning up
data, acquiring more data, and train our clip-based model more effectively.
• From Content Integrity, we aim to build a classifier (led by Real-time Integrity team - cc|
to build the
enforcement classifier. To my best understanding, we are working on live video problem together with multiple
partners from both enhancing infrastructure to content understanding for incredibly rare types of contents such
as shooting incidents, SSI, etc.
Today, in the absence of the classifier as the team is working on it, we do enqueue contents with very high threshold
(0.98), and the NZ videos might not make it to the queue due to video quality, and CO capacity.

do we have an updated answer to this question? E.g. today would the NZ video be
nG
flaged as it was live?
