TL;DR: On June 14th, we have deployed a first version of our video clip-based model,
XRayOC 2019a, for all FB traffic at upload time across all FB videos. This model features
several concepts, among them, a new first person shooter concept aimed to provide signals
that would help detecting new incidents like the NZ shooting. These concepts are available
via Video Understanding Repository.
What's new in this model
We introduced 3 new concepts into video space: vclip_car_crashing ,
vclip_cock_fighting, and vclip_first_person_shooting. Our new model is a head inside
XRayCore trunk (https://fb.workplace.com/notes)
