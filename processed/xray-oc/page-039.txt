To clear the confusion, the FPS model alone described in the note is a pure visual model. model
is referring to a meta-classifier that consumes FPS signal among with other visual and acoustic features (such as
gunshot, machine gun, etc), which we think should be a model that we aim to use in production. In Content Integrity,
this is the two-stage system that we've been using which proved to be very effective in other high-prevalence problems

And do we have the capacity to review it? E.g. would it be enqueued and reviewed and
taken down?

Is there more to read about the new GV live video model?

yes. The GV live video model scores the NZ shooting high enough that it would be
enqueued for review into a queue with a 5 minute SLA. If reviewed correctly, it would be taken down following the
review.
I have not yet published a note on the new model. I plan to have this out by the end of the quarter (ie. within the next
two weeks)
