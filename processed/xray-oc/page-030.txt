. We've reached out to PDO and we'll work with their team to ensure the quality.
There were quite a lot of problems when we eyeballed FPs and FNs, so it was quite
hard for us to debug the real FPs and FNs in the first iteration.
• Better audio understanding
Redacted for Congress
• It is clear that with visual signal only, we will miss a decent amount of contents. At
Realtime Integrity team, once they work on a new classifier, learning both from
visual and audio would benefit their system drastically. Today, our acoustic event
detection signals in Video Understanding Engine (VUE) are still missing a lot of
events, or the quality of detecting gunshots are still not clear to us. We would love
to work with partner teams owning this system and improve audio recognition.
• Define more operational metrics
O
Today, we evaluate our concept performance through how we serve our signals
through VUE. These are served in both clip-level and video-level scores. Therefore,
we evaluate our concepts based on this assumption, mainly on video-level scores.
We plan to spend more time to understand which metrics would benefit the most to
both our team and downstream clients (Graphic Violence, Realtime Integrity).
