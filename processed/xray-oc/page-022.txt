are labeled as positive sample when there were no gunshot fired.

don't see the gun quite well in the video.

• 10154333865096130: This is also hard. We can't really tell if the police officer fired
their weapon. From the text, it looks like the homeowner fired at those officers. We
don't really see the gun of this officer either, so we think this should be a negative
sample.
2087468144830123: This is indeed positive sample, though we don't really see the
FPS present much, so it's possible that our sampled frames didn't catch them well.

• 979876282153391, 531264043931536: This is another interesting example. It is
indeed FPS, but we should distinguish this from guns on land vs guns in the water.
We should not ignore this for different reasons.
