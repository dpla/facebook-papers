542638122561762: This was the incident back in 2015 of the two reporters in
Roanoke, Virginia. This is an incident that we would capture the content. In this
particular example, this is hard to catch in production because the shooting
happens really fast, and there is a good chance that our frame-sampling didn't catch
those frames. A second hypothesis is because of the windows splitting, with our
production frame-processing (resize and crop to get the frame down to 112X112),
there is a good possibility that we would miss the gun. I'll do a follow-up check on
this particular video to see why we scored very low on this video.

• 1753596228214660: This is a close-up FPS, which we should have capture. I'll do
more debugging on this sample as well.
• 1992060911048222: This should not be labeled as positive as this looks like an ad
from ammunition store. There was no gun-shot either.
Scoring live videos:
o Thanks to
we looked at contents with high FPS score in live video.
• There are a lot of false positive samples where the footage was coming from
dashcam in a car. We are aware of this problem as we do have a decent amount of
law enforcement officer in our training data.
