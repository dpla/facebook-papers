dismemberment and visible innards. We do capture gory and mAD contents in our
XRayOC frame-based model, so for downstream client, it should be fine. However,
we'll revisit these examples to evaluate if we shall change our definition of
carcrashing more. Based on our labeling taxonomy, it seemed to be positive sample.
o 10155563370198562: This one is probably a hard example. We do see multiple
people are injured yet some of them seemed to be alive. This is still considered as
positive from our labeling taxonomy.
