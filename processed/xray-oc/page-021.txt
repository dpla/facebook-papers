police officer did fire his weapon.

150344069107670: We should consider this as positive. If this is not real gunshot,
our acoustic detection system should be able to differentiate this rather than
leaving the visual model to learn this, especially with our production frame-
sampling mechanism.

person perspective.
• 1003009213195604: This was edited, and even watching the footage, we didn't
really see gunshot fired, so this is a controversial sample.
10205343622226843: This is another hard sample. We don't really see the gun for
the majority of the video, but there was gunshot. We should probably considered
this sample as negative as we can capture gunshot through acoustic event detection.
