Great work Very exited to support OC clip-based model inside the XRayCore trunk. Looking forwards to

O We did compare this with our offline data as I mentioned above. It's probably a lot better though in a
not-super-clean dataset. I assume what you meant is how this would reflect in our downstream clients in graphic
violence? If so, yes. We'll work with them on refreshing their classifier in a very short future.
