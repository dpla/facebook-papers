> Our global user base is never going to agree with all of our policies and enforcement decisions. Instead,
we should empower users to improve their own experience by giving them more control over what they see (and don't see).
Users agree we should take a stance and remove what is universally thought of as bad or illegal (e.g., CEI, terrorism,
violence, harassment) but leave it up to them to decide the rest. This would take some of the strain off of creating a content
regulation system that is agreed upon by everyone.
this is quite reasonable. do you know if there is any appetite within the company for an approach like this?

I think there's awareness of it (IX team has research on user controls) but I'm not sure if anything is
being built at the moment. There's also warning screens to cover borderline graphic violence and misinfo labels.

Ok, so there's awareness. what about making it so that we take a stance and remove only
what is universally thought of as bad or illegal, while leaving the rest of moderation up to the users to decide?
