The mission of the CI Legitimacy Team team is to help shape the overarching strategy for
increasing legitimacy of our integrity efforts and develop the measurement framework for
tracking legitimacy with people and stakeholders.
This series of three notes will present the legitimacy measurement strategy. In order to
measure perceived legitimacy we need to first understand how people currently view our
integrity efforts. This first note presents research that investigated (1) users' perceptions of

development of the LEGIT survey to measure progress with users and the general population
as well as how we are tracking public sentiment with stakeholders.
