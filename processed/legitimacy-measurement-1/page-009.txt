POC and marginalized groups are barely
able to stay afloat in an environment that
doesn't understand the minority
experience.
They attributed this to our policies and systems being designed by White upper/middle class
people who don't understand minority experiences. Many participants acknowledged much

Recommendations:
• Conduct audits of actions taken on content posted by people of color, to verify if we are
disproportionally actioning against one demographic's content
• Increase the representation of people from minority groups in our building process

• Ensure that any system we ship is not biased against certain groups (e.g., SAIL efforts).
