2. Stakeholders' perceptions of our integrity efforts
Investigating external stakeholders' (i.e., policy, civil society, academics, and the media)
perceptions of our integrity efforts is more challenging as it is difficult to reach these
audiences directly. In H2 2019 we took a pulse on where these audiences generally stand on
key integrity topics by aggregating insights from our internal policy and comms partners. See
the full table here.
Stakeholders' top areas of concerns include offline harms, how/if we incorporate feedback,
trust in the company, soft actions, procedural justice, US-centric policies, and misinfo. In
addition to disagreeing and being concerned about our approach to integrity, many
stakeholders either aren't aware of our efforts (e.g., that we publicly release our enforcement
rates in the CSER; that we work with law enforcement) or don't understand parts of our
systems (e.g., how we use machine learning to quickly remove content; how our policies are
formed).

These findings highlight the need for us to develop a scaled program to educate
stakeholders about our content moderation practices to help support the
excellent work by our stakeholder engagement, policy, and comms partners.
The Transparency Hub product vision is an initial way we could build legitimacy with
stakeholders by increasing awareness, decreasing confusion, and presenting a transparent
holistic narrative about our integrity efforts.
