TL;DR
1. Users don't trust us to do the right thing because they believe we prioritize revenue and
growth over safety and society
2. Users don't perceive our content regulation system as legitimate because they don't
trust our motivations, perceive our system to be ineffective and biased toward minority
groups, and believe that we don't understand or listen to our users
3. There are opportunities to increase legitimacy with users by building trust in the brand
through product experiences, ensuring we aren't biased toward certain groups, and
empowering users to control their own experience
4. In addition to disagreeing and being concerned about our approach to integrity, many
external stakeholders either aren't aware of our efforts or don't understand parts of our
systems
5. There are opportunities to increase legitimacy with stakeholders by developing scaled
education programs, telling a more cohesive and understandable narrative that is easily
discoverable and shareable, and building integrity products that are defensible
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
1. Users' perceptions of our integrity efforts
Three, three-hour research sessions were conducted in Seattle with groups of actors (n = 6),
reporters (n = 9) and general users (n = 11). These sessions investigated what users are
currently experiencing, perceiving, or hearing about that form their perceptions of our
integrity efforts. Participants were diverse with regard to gender, race, and age.
