We are planning to conduct additional research with our policy and comms partners as well
as stakeholders to further understand, synthesize, and prioritize needs and areas of concern
across stakeholder groups. We also need to understand what types of content will be the most
useful, how to contextualize and organize this information, and how to encourage more
informed stakeholders to share information with others.
The next note in this series will present proposed principles for building legitimacy with
people based on external research, internal research, and product strategy. The third note
will present the development of the LEGIT survey to measure progress with users and the
general population as well as how we are tracking public sentiment with stakeholders.
Huge thanks to
for helping design and run the Seattle research and to
for thoughtful feedback on this note and being my copy editors!
