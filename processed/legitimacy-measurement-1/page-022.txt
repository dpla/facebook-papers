Is there a definition of legitimacy somewhere?

note 2 (coming soon!) will cover this more in-depth but TL;DR:
1) From a policing/government perspective, legitimacy is the belief that an entity should be able to make and
enforce rules and that people should follow these rules
2) From an organizational perspective, legitimacy is the belief that an organization's actions are appropriate and
desirable within society's norms and values
• We of course want people to believe (1) and want people to follow our Community Standards but we know from
survey data and qualitative research insights most users already agree "yeah, you're a private company you can
make your own rules/do what you want" so measuring (1) isn't super informative or valuable.
• However, we know from research people don't tend to agree with our rules, how we enforce them, how we treat
users, that what we do is effective etc. This is in line with definition (2) and thus, measuring these perceptions is
more impactful AND we can actually do something about these things.
