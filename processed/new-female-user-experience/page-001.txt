Being a new, female user is not a great experience in most emerging
markets
I recently published a note about how we do not survey new users in TRIPS but should since
they appear to have more negative experiences. At the suggestion of
L included a cut
by country and, at
is suggestion, I also included a gender cut. The
results are stark.
In the US, women with <30d tenure on platform give -30% more USI than men. In most
European countries the gap is closer to 10%. In ID the gap is 170%. IN, BR, AR, PH, NG and ZA
also have gaps of over 100%.
One possible explanation is that women simply give more USI overall in these countries and it
has nothing to do with tenure. The other plot below shows the relative USI ratio between the
first month on the platform and months 9-12. That plot shows that, while there are overall
gender effects, there is also a tenure-specific factor. For instance, women in ID give 3.3x more
USI in their first month than in months 9-12, but for men the ratio is only 2.2x.
I have not performed this analysis on civic-specific content, but I suspect we will see a similar
(or worse) trend. Especially since we already have evidence that women are participating less in
civic discussions. I do not have specific remediation recommendations at this point, but would
be interested in collaborating further.
