work is highly relevant here, since she actually looked at
gender disparities in literacy around the world
(https://fb.workplace.com/notes measuring-online-language-
literacy-in-12-language/274339023863105/), as well as other work on
gender differences in participation! (https://fb.workplace.com/notes/

Thanks! I'd be happy to learn that someone else is already doing this
and perhaps we can contribute research/data to that effort.
