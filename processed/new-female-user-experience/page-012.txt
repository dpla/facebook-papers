There are quite a lot of correlational analysis linking integrity to retention. In
terms of causational evidence, 2 things I think of is (1) locked profiles led to
DAP win, and (2) positive retention gain in our friending integrity holdout
(link).
Friending integrity for India female is one of the major areas in our India
strategy. We are testing different integrity filters on male to female friending
requests. We are also building a survey-based "uncomfortable friending
classifier" to demote sketchy friending. But these are all still WIP, and we will
have something to share later this quarter.

Can we have the gap by USI breakdown? So that we know where is the problem
really coming from.
