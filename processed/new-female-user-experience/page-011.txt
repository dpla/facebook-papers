Another question: do we have data on whether these new users are dropping off
the platform at higher levels by gender or in proportion to perceived
harassment/USI?

I'm preparing another analysis of the churn/retention aspect, but it will
probably be a few weeks before that is done. tl;dr is that yes, users who give
more USI do have worse retention on the platform.

I wonder whether Core growth has done some
analysis to evaluate the impact of Integrity experiences (e.g.: as indicated by USI)
on retention. I wonder whether tightening some of the controls (e.g.: Group
preview feature that shows content to the user before they accept the invitation
from the group) could improve retention for women in emerging countries (and
some other demographics)

we've definitely looked for India, looking into unwanted friending, comments,
messaging etc for women. There's lot of correlative and some experimental
evidence I believe between some of the work on locked profile and maybe
even some live friending tests.
are there any tests we can share?
