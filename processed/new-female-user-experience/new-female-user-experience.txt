Civic Understanding (UXR, DS, CDS & Friends)
September 10, 2020.
Being a new, female user is not a great experience in most emerging
markets
I recently published a note about how we do not survey new users in TRIPS but should since
they appear to have more negative experiences. At the suggestion of
L included a cut
by country and, at
is suggestion, I also included a gender cut. The
results are stark.
In the US, women with <30d tenure on platform give -30% more USI than men. In most
European countries the gap is closer to 10%. In ID the gap is 170%. IN, BR, AR, PH, NG and ZA
also have gaps of over 100%.
One possible explanation is that women simply give more USI overall in these countries and it
has nothing to do with tenure. The other plot below shows the relative USI ratio between the
first month on the platform and months 9-12. That plot shows that, while there are overall
gender effects, there is also a tenure-specific factor. For instance, women in ID give 3.3x more
USI in their first month than in months 9-12, but for men the ratio is only 2.2x.
I have not performed this analysis on civic-specific content, but I suspect we will see a similar
(or worse) trend. Especially since we already have evidence that women are participating less in
civic discussions. I do not have specific remediation recommendations at this point, but would
be interested in collaborating further.

this was the other finding I mentioned in our 1:1 today. Also perhaps of
interest to
- I'd love to consider a workstream toward improving the
onboarding experience of women in lower literacy countries with a goal of reducing
the disparities in the above graphs, perhaps by creating better initial sources to
follow.
Unlike many workstreams, we have a readily made metric already, though some
have pointed out that a part of the above could be due to people signing up fake
accounts to report others. Still, this converges with other findings (e.g. note
on how phone shops connect people to sources on
work on gendered
harassment or
notes on how easy it is to rabbit hole in
recommendations) such that I'm inclined to believe at least some of this is due to
actually bad onboarding experiences for women in these markets. And there is an
easy growth argument to be made for doing something about this as well as
allowing bad experiences for new users seems like a poor long term growth tactic.

I think
work is highly relevant here, since she actually looked at
gender disparities in literacy around the world
(https://fb.workplace.com/notes measuring-online-language-
literacy-in-12-language/274339023863105/), as well as other work on
gender differences in participation! (https://fb.workplace.com/notes/

Better onboarding experience of women inlower literacy countries sounds
wise, and the Women in Emerging Markets team may have already done
some onboarding work (cc)

Thanks! I'd be happy to learn that someone else is already doing this
and perhaps we can contribute research/data to that effort.

You should also check out

reducing gender gaps in civic participation through the locked profile:

would be great to connect. We have 2 teams in Growth
focused on a) women (primarily Safety) and b) easier onboarding for recent
internet adopters, so happy to connect about either/both. is our
Research Lead who has a wealth of great information too

Friending is working on labeling/understanding uncomfortable/unwanted

Could this be a helpful way to approach the B&H issues in MM

Maybe something you're already doing, but gender specific B&H
can sometimes be caught better by the sexually suggestive classifier vs.
B&H. e.g.
https://fb.workplace.com/groups/655489201588520/permalink/9164725
48823516). Perhaps you could try to bootstrap such a classifier leveraging
comments reported for B&H by women that are non-violating but have
certain words? Or maybe there is a way to leverage green lantern/CIRD in this
direction?

wonder if looking at USI w/o filtering further would actually be
informative. It's possible that negative interactions actually are not caught
very well but our current classifiers. Probably depends on how overt the
harassment is.

yes Rxactly - a lot of perceived harassment is explicitly non-
violating per our current intervention standards. So it's very likely that people
are seeing harassment which is decreasing their experience quality and
potentially driving them off the platform that our classifiers do not identify as
actionable or even borderline. This only goes double for markets and
languages that we have poor or no coverage in for those classifieds.

Some kind of concerted approach to Gender Rights or Experience

primary barrier to participation: https://fb.workplace.com/groups/indiapac/

Do we know what % of USI comes from friending?

Another question: do we have data on whether these new users are dropping off
the platform at higher levels by gender or in proportion to perceived
harassment/USI?

I'm preparing another analysis of the churn/retention aspect, but it will
probably be a few weeks before that is done. tl;dr is that yes, users who give
more USI do have worse retention on the platform.

I wonder whether Core growth has done some
analysis to evaluate the impact of Integrity experiences (e.g.: as indicated by USI)
on retention. I wonder whether tightening some of the controls (e.g.: Group
preview feature that shows content to the user before they accept the invitation
from the group) could improve retention for women in emerging countries (and
some other demographics)

we've definitely looked for India, looking into unwanted friending, comments,
messaging etc for women. There's lot of correlative and some experimental
evidence I believe between some of the work on locked profile and maybe
even some live friending tests.
are there any tests we can share?

There are quite a lot of correlational analysis linking integrity to retention. In
terms of causational evidence, 2 things I think of is (1) locked profiles led to
DAP win, and (2) positive retention gain in our friending integrity holdout
(link).
Friending integrity for India female is one of the major areas in our India
strategy. We are testing different integrity filters on male to female friending
requests. We are also building a survey-based "uncomfortable friending
classifier" to demote sketchy friending. But these are all still WIP, and we will
have something to share later this quarter.

Can we have the gap by USI breakdown? So that we know where is the problem
really coming from.

I wonder how we an rethink the experience for
new users, particularly women in developing countries, to ensure they can
end up with higher quality feed. Would be good to experiment with how that
improves retention for the users

Probably a sad novelty effect in play here - people would stop giving feedback
once they've tried to do so without getting much in return. The difference of 3.3x
on female vs 2.2x on male could be saying that females are more likely to be
discouraged from taking actions on negative experiences over time.

that's a really interesting point and one that would probably be best
answered via a survey.
is this something that Digital Illiteracy/
CVI research might investigate? Seems very much relevant to the lightweight
negative feedback work.
