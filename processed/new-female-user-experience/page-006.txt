this was the other finding I mentioned in our 1:1 today. Also perhaps of
interest to
- I'd love to consider a workstream toward improving the
onboarding experience of women in lower literacy countries with a goal of reducing
the disparities in the above graphs, perhaps by creating better initial sources to
follow.
Unlike many workstreams, we have a readily made metric already, though some
have pointed out that a part of the above could be due to people signing up fake
accounts to report others. Still, this converges with other findings (e.g. note
on how phone shops connect people to sources on
work on gendered
harassment or
notes on how easy it is to rabbit hole in
recommendations) such that I'm inclined to believe at least some of this is due to
actually bad onboarding experiences for women in these markets. And there is an
easy growth argument to be made for doing something about this as well as
allowing bad experiences for new users seems like a poor long term growth tactic.
