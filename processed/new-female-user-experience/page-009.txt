Maybe something you're already doing, but gender specific B&H
can sometimes be caught better by the sexually suggestive classifier vs.
B&H. e.g.
https://fb.workplace.com/groups/655489201588520/permalink/9164725
48823516). Perhaps you could try to bootstrap such a classifier leveraging
comments reported for B&H by women that are non-violating but have
certain words? Or maybe there is a way to leverage green lantern/CIRD in this
direction?

wonder if looking at USI w/o filtering further would actually be
informative. It's possible that negative interactions actually are not caught
very well but our current classifiers. Probably depends on how overt the
harassment is.

yes Rxactly - a lot of perceived harassment is explicitly non-
violating per our current intervention standards. So it's very likely that people
are seeing harassment which is decreasing their experience quality and
potentially driving them off the platform that our classifiers do not identify as
actionable or even borderline. This only goes double for markets and
languages that we have poor or no coverage in for those classifieds.
