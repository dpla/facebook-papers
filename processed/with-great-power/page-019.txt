by internalizing to you mean believe the narrative the media is trying to craft around Facebook? Or do you
mean understand (not necessarily agree with) the narrative that they're trying to cast?

Understand and don't immediately discount. Read it with a critical, open eye and don't default to
everything they're saying is wrong. Figure out ways you can make things better - doesn't have to be big things (for
my, it's sharing product feedback). But figure out what that is for you and commit.

eventually going to stop listening to him.

"..It's to hold institutions of power accountable." Thanks for these important words regarding the job of the
press. It's tough to read criticism and I agree it should be turned into motivation to "learn from this and do better." Thanks!
