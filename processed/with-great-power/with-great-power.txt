THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2018 . READING TIME: 4 MINUTES
I'm not in Comms, but I'm going to to go out on a limb and say that these last few weeks have
been brutal for Facebook, Inc. in the press (See: here, here, here and here (ch, and here, an
exception)). I've been here a while so my friends typically don't bother me a ton with
Facebook-related articles, but over the last few days, I've had four different friends and
family members ask me about recent news.

Having spent the last seven years of my life working at places that have gotten a lot of media
attention (5.2 years combined at Facebook plus two presidential campaigns), I wanted to
share my approach to reading tough news stories that I've learned over the years, View this as
one person's perspective, but I share all of this in the hopes that when negative and tough
articles get published, we let our Comms team do their jobs - push back and correct details
and narrative, as needed – and we focus on understanding what we can learn from external
criticism and how we can make our products and our company better.
-
Three things:
First, read the articles. Every word. Then read it again. Sounds simple, but this
doesn't always happen before people feel the need to react to parts of stories or details
that they think are wrong. And by read articles, I don't mean a HuffPo synopsis of the
synopsis of the story or an Axios Be Smart summary (brevity is not always smart, sorry),
or the most critical part of the story excerpted in the comments section of an FYI post.
Read the original story from the original source. Twice.

criticism we get and collectively take responsibility that we're the largest platform

that. I personally am glad that the press is holding us to account (note: this isn't me
saying leak. Don't leak). Reputable media may not get all details right ever - heck,
that's because companies like ours only share so many details externally - but you
know what? Typically the narratives have shades of truth. Taking the articles I listed
above as an example: Pulse scores were off, the last few years have been tough,
sometimes we get blamed for things that aren't directly our fault and we haven't always
had the best privacy controls (oh, and we built a tool that raised a ton of money for
causes). Internalize that and use this to help us get better. That's why I'm here, that's
why I stay, and that's why I'm excited to find ways to make our company and our
products better every day.
Third, be the change. Rather than rally against the value of the free press, help be
part of the solution. See something you don't agree with internally? Say something (and
be specific and constructive)! Feel strongly about an issue? Talk to the team working on
it (and be specific and constructive)! Disagree with approach? Ask about it at Q&A! I
personally channel this energy by posting a lot of feedback in groups. That may not world
for you - and that's ok! Figure out what does work for you. We work at a company that
empowers anyone to have an idea and see it hit production the next day. Use this power
smartly, though, please - don't be a jerk.

I'm personally excited by this challenge. When friends and family ask me about Facebook,
why I'm here and why I stay, I tell them I've never been more energized by helping to make
our platform better, learning from our mistakes and charting the future course for a platform
that makes a positive impact on billions of people across the world. Let's not lose sight of that
nor should we ever lose sight of learning from external (or internal) criticism.

I hear you but that frequently seems inadequate because the damage has already been done. I
remember an NPR news segment circa 2014-2015 where the reporter said that we sell users' data that got me so
angry I pounded my fist on my car's dashboard at a stop light. They later modified the online text version of the same
story to say "Facebook says that they don't sell user data." I was profoundly disappointed with NPR here and haven't

I agree it's hard to not take things personally when you care about an issue. However,
with great power (2B+ people's trust), comes great responsibility. It's easier said than done and requires explicit
effort to pause the defensive thread and reason out the root causes of criticisms / feedbacks. It's imperative that we
take a step back, look at it objectively from a "3rd-person-perspective" and then try to weigh the criticism effectively,
pick the legit ones and roll up our sleeves and try to be part of the solutions team.

As you write, it's easy to get caught up in little details that are painted unfairly -- and there are definitely some things in
press that miss the mark! But that misses the point: We are a company at the center of 2B people's lives and have a great
responsibility to do better. I especially challenge my colleagues who work on product teams to hold ourselves to higher
standards. Consider stress cases and integrity; consult researchers on well-being; align behind metrics that track to your
mission, not the other way around (and call your team out when you start to game numbers).
Facebook is a company built on thousands of decisions rank and file employees make every day, and if we each do a little
better, we can steer the ship to a healthier place.

don't think they're doing a good job, figure out a way to give constructive feedback or join the team and become a
comms professional! Or even better - help to build tools that prevent bad things from becoming even close to bad
stories in the first place!

Just to jump in here, I previously worked at a top news outlet (not NYT but
another household name) on the business side. Every conversation with senior leadership was about revenue shifting
from print to digital and competition against Google and FB. Is that enough to prove that journalism is biased? No, by
declining revenues impacts employee (journalists') compensation, benefits, morale, etc. and may affect their
coverage on FB--whether subconsciously or purposely.

what I'm saying is there's a difference between the business side and editorial side. Are
you saying that the editorial side is skewing its coverage of Facebook because the business side isn't doing as well?
wouldn't be surprised that this would be a concern on the business side, just as it would be for any other company
that makes money off of advertising.
Like · Reply · 2y
Unless we work there we won't know for sure if the editorial side is skewing their
coverage or not, but NYT's steep declines in revenue impact the editorial side's compensation, benefits, bonuses,
morale and optimism, etc. So challenges on the business side definitely impact those on the editorial side and may be
considered in their coverage.
Another factor to consider is influence. Before FB, people got news from NYT and other similar sources. Now a lot of
people get news from other sources through FB and Twitter. In some ways, FB is limiting the reach and therefore
influence that the NYT editorial side has on audiences.

Are we as bad as they say we are now? Absolutely not. It's never going to be black or white. As a society, we're
figuring this out together, and it goes beyond us. What's the role of media in the age of disruption? How can
other social media platforms spark better discourse? How can WE spark better discourse? What is driven by
human nature vs. our platform and how do we account for that? No easy answers for any of that, but I'd rather
be at a place that's at the center of this and committed to making things better rather than rabble-rousing from
the outside.
We as a society need to find a better balance on this pendulum and we play an important part, but we're not the only

particularly anyone in the press - makes a mistake, it's a sign that they're malicious and never to be trusted again going

I think "assume good intent" should be, if anything, practiced even more aggressively with people who aren't here to defend
themselves. If we assume the best of ourselves and not "others", that's not healthy culture. That's a cult.

Let me clarify, because short snippishness isn't helpful and I apologize for that -
If it were just one or two people saying these things, I would not be concerned, and I would talk to them directly - as
we did yesterday, Dean.
I see a high number of people here expressing enormous negativity towards the press that I do not feel is fair or
earned, and demanding enormously higher standards from them than from us - standards impossible for anyone to
meet.
If you're not in agreement that anyone is saying anything like that or there's any cause for alarm, that's fine - we have
enormously different value systems at the very least and that can't be solved in a single discussion in a platform
that's not great for nuanced discussion. I want to express appreciation for 's thoughts here and move on.

It is so earned. Here's a couple of patently false articles from supposedly reputable NYT about FB:
https://www.nytimes.com/.../jobs-facebook-computer...
https://www.nytimes.com/.../users-abandon-facebook.html
In both cases it's been pointed out that both recruiting is doing just fine (if not better) and hashtag deletefacebook
hasn't translated to actual deletions.
The latest NYT is loaded with misogynist and anti-Semitic wording, language I pointed out to you in chat and others

I'm happy to furnish more data that show any regard for the press is completely misguided here in the 21st century.

Understand and don't immediately discount. Read it with a critical, open eye and don't default to
everything they're saying is wrong. Figure out ways you can make things better - doesn't have to be big things (for
my, it's sharing product feedback). But figure out what that is for you and commit.

I have an open mind as much as the next guy, but if the same "friend" keeps offering bad advice, I'm
eventually going to stop listening to him.
Stamos worded it best, I think: https://twitter.com/ScottShaneNYT/status/1063212149357596672

"..It's to hold institutions of power accountable." Thanks for these important words regarding the job of the
press. It's tough to read criticism and I agree it should be turned into motivation to "learn from this and do better." Thanks!

Agree with your points about learning from criticism. Strongly disagree with your assertion that the United
States' Mainstream (Mass) Media (MSM) holds people in power accountable categorically - look at the wildly different tone
in reporting between President Trump and President Obama. Ignoring the partisan issue, didn't some news executives use
their power to suppress reporting on Harvey Weinstein? This isn't an indictment of the press, but it should inform the way
we understand their reports. Frankly, the MSM seems incredibly elitist - Jamal Khashoggi's death got more coverage than
the entire war in Yemen. And the MSM was so #shook on election night 2016 that some of the anchors broke into tears -
can't imagine what sort of bubble they were in to fail to recognize that Trump had a legitimate chance of winning. If you
want to a chuckle, look at what happened when someone started asking reporters if they knew someone who (owned a pick
up truck] (https://www.dailywire.com/.../journalists-lose-it-after...) - keep in mind that pick up trucks are among the best
selling vehicles in America.
I'm not here to be the arbiter of what's valid criticism and what isn't. Just here to submit that idea that looking to the press
to understand the spectrum of criticism is incredibly misguided (see point above about the press' spectacular failings and
elite self-interest, additionally it's apparent that our business of connecting people is a threat to the hierarchical control of
information that the press enjoys - read Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent if you'd like to learn more) and we'd
probably do a disservice to 99.9% of our user base if we let the MSM determine what our issues are.

Sorry for the delayed response - I'm not trying to dodge this but I am going to decline to put
my perspective on the record - this isn't about me. However, I tend to be in broad agreement with Leo Strauss,
Thomas Aquinas, Maimonides, Thomas Hobbes, and Aristotle and think they're mostly right about the important
