But we do amazing things every day! We deserve positive coverage! Yes we do, no
we don't. The press's job isn't to reproduce our press releases. It's to hold institutions of
power accountable. We are an institution of power, and I'm thankful for the role the press
plays. Let's learn from this and do better.
I'm personally excited by this challenge. When friends and family ask me about Facebook,
why I'm here and why I stay, I tell them I've never been more energized by helping to make
our platform better, learning from our mistakes and charting the future course for a platform
that makes a positive impact on billions of people across the world. Let's not lose sight of that
nor should we ever lose sight of learning from external (or internal) criticism.
