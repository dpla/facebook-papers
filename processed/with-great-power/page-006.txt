Reminds me of "I would rather be hurt by a truth than be comforted by a lie". Truth isn't always comfortable
and sometimes comes in the form of criticism.

I hear you but that frequently seems inadequate because the damage has already been done. I
remember an NPR news segment circa 2014-2015 where the reporter said that we sell users' data that got me so

story to say "Facebook says that they don't sell user data." I was profoundly disappointed with NPR here and haven't
donated since.

them to be accountable to getting their facts right and owning their mistakes.
