O Which I'm assuming is sometimes easier said than done, which is probably worth a while separate

My larger point is it doesn't help if we turn the debate into the press sucks. I'm all for flagging issues
and mistakes to the comms team - but the press bashing I've seen isn't helpful or productive.

I agree it's hard to not take things personally when you care about an issue. However,
with great power (2B+ people's trust), comes great responsibility. It's easier said than done and requires explicit
effort to pause the defensive thread and reason out the root causes of criticisms / feedbacks. It's imperative that we
take a step back, look at it objectively from a "3rd-person-perspective" and then try to weigh the criticism effectively,
pick the legit ones and roll up our sleeves and try to be part of the solutions team.

I've actually always felt appreciative of your internal comments on large issues. You've got an extremely
rational approach to these things and this note is a fantastic guide to navigating these tough conversations.
