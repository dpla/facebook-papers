You fundamentally don't understand my argument.

I think you're referring to at least some of the discussions we've had. My perspective is better
expressed as, "how [people) are [unreliable) and can't be trusted any time". I don't single out the press, or criticism
of Facebook, and I don't consider most people liars. The problem is that as humans we never have the full picture.
Our own lives are these insanely crafted adventures which make perfect sense and everyone else has it wrong. But
that's how we all think and we can't all be right (or wrong!)

Let me clarify, because short snippishness isn't helpful and I apologize for that -
If it were just one or two people saying these things, I would not be concerned, and I would talk to them directly - as
we did yesterday, Dean.
I see a high number of people here expressing enormous negativity towards the press that I do not feel is fair or
earned, and demanding enormously higher standards from them than from us - standards impossible for anyone to
meet.
If you're not in agreement that anyone is saying anything like that or there's any cause for alarm, that's fine - we have
enormously different value systems at the very least and that can't be solved in a single discussion in a platform
that's not great for nuanced discussion. I want to express appreciation for 's thoughts here and move on.

It is so earned. Here's a couple of patently false articles from supposedly reputable NYT about FB:
https://www.nytimes.com/.../jobs-facebook-computer...
https://www.nytimes.com/.../users-abandon-facebook.html
In both cases it's been pointed out that both recruiting is doing just fine (if not better) and hashtag deletefacebook
hasn't translated to actual deletions.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
The latest NYT is loaded with misogynist and anti-Semitic wording, language I pointed out to you in chat and others
spotted as well: https://fb.facebook.com/.../permalink/1918693318166163/
Stamos called the NYT on the carpet over this and got one of the writers to concede:

But it doesn't even have to be about FB that the media gets patently false. Good news is simply buried by traditional
media because it doesn't sell clicks. You never see a headline that reads, "Crime has fallen 400% in the last 20 years"
but that headline would be completely true (http://www.pewresearch.org/.../ft_16-11-16_crime trend 2 For thie fart
alone, I consider the press to be asleep at their jobs and complicit with a panicked society.
