This was an important reminder for me "... I've never been more energized by helping to make our
platform better, learning from our mistakes and charting the future course for a platform that makes a positive impact on
billions of people across the world. Let's not lose sight of that nor should we ever lose sight of learning from external (or
internal) criticism."

I think your post assumes good intent from the press. I think it's naïve, and I don't think you appreciate how
fatal to the company that naïveté can be.

[pasting my comment here from the FYI thread - let's centralize this discussion here]
that's actually not what I assume at all. My point is that the comms team has a job - we should let them do it. If you
don't think they're doing a good job, figure out a way to give constructive feedback or join the team and become a
comms professional! Or even better - help to build tools that prevent bad things from becoming even close to bad
stories in the first place!
Channel press bashing into something productive to make everything that we do better.

O I really do want to understand your point. My point isn't that the press is perfect. But by getting
defensive about every little thing they say, that benefits no one and enables us to dig in and think that any external
criticism is wrong, which is extremely dangerous.
