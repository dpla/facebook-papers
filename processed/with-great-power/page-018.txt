It is so earned. Here's a couple of patently false articles from supposedly reputable NYT about FB:
https://www.nytimes.com/.../jobs-facebook-computer...
https://www.nytimes.com/.../users-abandon-facebook.html
In both cases it's been pointed out that both recruiting is doing just fine (if not better) and hashtag deletefacebook
hasn't translated to actual deletions.
The latest NYT is loaded with misogynist and anti-Semitic wording, language I pointed out to you in chat and others
spotted as well: https://fb.facebook.com/.../permalink/1918693318166163/
Stamos called the NYT on the carpet over this and got one of the writers to concede:

But it doesn't even have to be about FB that the media gets patently false. Good news is simply buried by traditional
media because it doesn't sell clicks. You never see a headline that reads, "Crime has fallen 400% in the last 20 years"
but that headline would be completely true (http://www.pewresearch.org/.../ft_16-11-16_crime_trend-2/). For this fact
alone, I consider the press to be asleep at their jobs and complicit with a panicked society.
I'm happy to furnish more data that show any regard for the press is completely misguided here in the 21st century.

by internalizing to you mean believe the narrative the media is trying to craft around Facebook? Or do you
mean understand (not necessarily agree with) the narrative that they're trying to cast?

Understand and don't immediately discount. Read it with a critical, open eye and don't default to
everything they're saying is wrong. Figure out ways you can make things better - doesn't have to be big things (for
my, it's sharing product feedback). But figure out what that is for you and commit.
