Vaccines are not efficacious or not necessary
Vaccines are not effective in preventing the disease against which they purport to protect
The majority of people who get disease have been vaccinated, showing they don't work
Diseases had already begun to disappear before vaccines were introduced, because of better
hygiene and sanitation
- Vaccine preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from my country, so there is no need
for my child to be vaccinated
Recommended Vaccine schedules are unsafe
Giving a child multiple vaccinations at the same time increases the risk of harmful side effects
and can overload the immune system
Children get too many immunizations which poses safety risks
Vaccines are safer if spread apart/ spaced out
Infant immune systems can't handle so many vaccines
Vitamin C can prevent measles
The diseases which the vaccination targets are not dangerous, so there is no need for vaccination
The diseases we vaccinate against are not dangerous or deadly, including but not limited to:
• Chickenpox (Varicella), Diphtheria, Flu (Influenza), Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hib
(Haemophilus influenzae type b), HPV (Human Papillomavirus), Measles, Meningococcal,
Mumps, Pneumococcal, Polio (Poliomyelitis), Rotavirus, Rubella (German measles).
Shingles (Herpes Zoster), Tetanus (Lockjaw), Whooping Cough (Pertussis)
• Vaccination is a violation of civil or religious liberties
o Enforcing a mandatory vaccination policy/schedule is a violation of civil liberties/rights
• Parents have the right to choose whether their kids are vaccinated
- Patients have the right to choose what goes into their own bodies
- Women's right to choose what is injected into her child
Lots of related variants of the above under the vaccination "pro-choice" framing
Children/Parents are not able to give informed consent
• Enforcing a mandatory policy/schedule is a violation of religious or moral beliefs
Religious doctrine/teachings are not compatible with vaccination
Religious-, health, or morals-based dietary restrictions are not compatible with vaccination
God created diseases for a reason, and it is wrong to thwart God's will via vaccination
