FCU Feedback & XFN (FIT, UIP, Content Understanding)
February 4.
FIT subtopic (climate science, climate change & global warming, earth science etc.)
guidelines for content classification
What we are doing -
We are from a search integrity team and working to minimize the spread of harm for climate
change topics in this H1 through SERP. We are in the very initial stage and working on
developing guidelines and query sets.
What helps we are looking for -
I found that "actor_inferred_tags_signal:feed table' has subtopics classification for climate
science, climate change & global warming, earth science, environmental science, atmospheric
science.
Ask -
Do you have guidelines with which you use to classify the content in above mentioned sub-
topics topics? If so, could it be possible to share with us?
