FCU Feedback & XFN (FIT, UIP, Content Understanding)
February 4.
FIT subtopic (climate science, climate change & global warming, earth science etc.)
guidelines for content classification
What we are doing -
We are from a search integrity team and working to minimize the spread of harm for climate
change topics in this H1 through SERP. We are in the very initial stage and working on
developing guidelines and query sets.
What helps we are looking for -
I found that "actor_inferred_tags_signal:feed table' has subtopics classification for climate
science, climate change & global warming, earth science, environmental science, atmospheric
science.
Ask -
Do you have guidelines with which you use to classify the content in above mentioned sub-
topics topics? If so, could it be possible to share with us?

Search Integrity: XFN
August 21, 2019
Climate change misinformation
Do we specifically consider climate change as a sensitive area for integrity? I'm wondering
whether we have policies in place that would apply to misleading autocomplete suggestions
when searching for terms like "climate change".
If someone is using Facebook Search to deliberately sow doubt and slow down the public
response to the climate crisis, they are using our service to jeopardize the lives of billions of
people over the coming decades. Is that an attack we are prepared for?

Climate Change Integrity Discussion
August 21, 2019
When I searched for "climate change" yesterday on FB, 2 of the 3 autocomplete
suggestions are very misleading.
In general, do our policies combatting the spread of misinformation on Facebook apply to
climate denialism?
In specific, do we have any policy or mechanism in place that would remove these
misleading suggestions? Search suggestion algorithms seem like a pretty high-leverage
target to people trying to manipulate public opinion, so we should have some protections
in place against someone "google bombing" FB search.

any idea if we've tackled this for the TA?

we don't currently incorporate climate change in our TA labeling
guidelines. looking at Implementation Standards, climate change does not
explicitly violate policy either (though this may fall under misinfo and we'd
need to clarify Search's policy on this)

[DEPRECATAED] Typeahead Integrity Rating
Guidelines v2.0 (08/07/2019)
Overview
Workflow Goals & Context
This document serves as the guideline for all TypeAhead Integrity rating flows. Integrity flows aim to improve the quality of
the Facebook Typeahead module by labeling text strings which populate based on a query the user enters into the search
bar. As a rater, your goal is to identify whether or not the string is sensitive, and if so, assign a sensitive label based on
the categories and criteria outlined in the guideline.

• Protected group characteristics: The following characteristics are protected: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious
affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex or gender identity, serious disability or disease. Hate speech includes attacks
which target hate or harassment against individuals and groups who identify under any of these characteristics.
• Regulated goods: Prescription drugs, non-medical drugs(eg: marijuana), animals(eg: husky, snake) and firearms (eg:
bomb, weapon).
o Animal sales, unless by:
Brick-and-mortar entities
Animal rehoming entities or shelters
• Marijuana is used to achieve a 'high' and purchase/sale/trade. Hash oil, weed, oil, liquid cannabis, and spice are
related to and should be treated like marijuana. CBD products, including CBD oil is a component of the cannabis
plant but does not cause a 'high', so it is non-violating and should not be treated like marijuana. Sale/purchase/trade
of marijuana related paraphernalia (bongs, pipes, etc.) do not violate.
• A non-medical drug is any drug that:
o does not repair an type of physical or psychological condition;
o does not achieve a legitimate medical purpose or procedure;
a is described by an external source as being used to achieve a 'high' or altered state of being, although not
necessarily as its primary use.
• A pharmaceutical drug is any drug used to treat a medical condition that is not widely available without a
prescription. If you can find a drug in a basic first aid kit, it generally is not a pharmaceutical drug. For example,
headache medicine (aspirin, ibuprofin, tylenol, etc.), cough drops, vitamins, protein powders or supplements are not
considered pharmaceutical drugs. When in doubt, you can check the status of a drug
at: https://www.drugs.com/drug_information.html. If it is described as anything but 'OTC' then it is likely a
pharmaceutical drug. Birth control (pills, rings, IUDs, etc.) and abortion inducing medications are considered
pharmaceutical products, but condoms are not

Rating Steps & Instructions
1 - Assess the text string to determine whether there is sensitive intent. Is this a query I suggestion string which could
surface sensitive content?
2 - Foreign language should not surface (exception: you are an i18n rater and the suggestion is your market language +
English). If you come across foreign/unrecognizable language in the suggestion string, select the label "O - Skip".
3 - If the query / suggestion is Sensitive, select the label "1 - Sensitive" and the offensive category it falls under. All
1
sensitive selections will also require you to submit the keyword(s) that are offensive in the string. If there are multiple
words, please separate with a comma (i.e. 'fucking slut' = fucking, slut).
3 - If the query / suggestion is Not Sensitive, then select the label "2 - Acceptable".
Label Definitions
0 - Skip
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Use 0 - Skip for foreign language query / suggestion strings for which you do not understand all or part of the text, and you
cannot understand enough to rate. This includes query / suggestion strings which are completely or partially in a language
foreign to the language of the workflow in which you are rating (Latin or non-Latin characters). In the English US market
you may skip queries/suggestions with multiple languages.
This does not include query / suggestion strings which are recognizably sensitive. If the text string is sensitive (eg "video
porno"), DO NOT skip, even if it is in a foreign language. In other words, if you can recognize that the string is sensitive, then
rate it sensitive.
In order to consider whether a query / suggestion is foreign, only look at strings longer than 3 letters. If the string is a
partial word, or only a few characters long, do not assure it is foreign. Keep in mind that some languages frequently use

could be prefixes to English words.

suggestions containing English. In some i18n markets, you should not automatically skip for queries/suggestions
containing multiple languages. Often, English is used in combination with the market language. Therefore, please rate for

1 - Sensitive
You should rate sensitive for queries / suggestions which trigger images, posts, and all other content that is harmful or
sensitive based on the following characteristics: risk of harm, threats to public safety, or otherwise sensitive content
Select the label 1 - Sensitive if the string falls in one of the following categories. If you mark a result sensitive, then you will
need to classify the content by selecting a sub-label from the following sensitive categories.
Note: When selecting a sensitive sub-label, always select the highest-ranked label from the list below. For example, if a
sensitive result contains both Hate Speech and Profanity, you should select Hate Speech since it is ranked higher in the
hierarchy of labels

• Many common names may generate pornographic results (e.g."mary ann"), these should not be considered sensitive.
• A string such as "phonograph photos" is not sensitive in nature. A side search will show that a phonograph is an audio
device, and so photos of this are not considered sensitive.
For any incomplete suggestions, do your best in assessing whether it is very likely to be completed in a specific form, and
rate based on that. For example:
"girls having se". It is very likely that the last word is an incomplete form of "sex", and you should rate the string
sensitive.
• "dirty pu" - The string is incomplete, and unclear enough that we cannot determine intent. A side search may show
various results, meaning that it is not certain that "dirty pu" is an incomplete form of "dirty pussy". In cases like this,
you should not rate the string sensitive.
0 - CHILD EXPLOITATION

for my child to be vaccinated
Recommended Vaccine schedules are unsafe
Giving a child multiple vaccinations at the same time increases the risk of harmful side effects
and can overload the immune system
Children get too many immunizations which poses safety risks
Vaccines are safer if spread apart/ spaced out
Infant immune systems can't handle so many vaccines
Vitamin C can prevent measles
The diseases which the vaccination targets are not dangerous, so there is no need for vaccination
The diseases we vaccinate against are not dangerous or deadly, including but not limited to:
