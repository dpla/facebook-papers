Label Definitions
0 - Skip
Use 0 - Skip for foreign language query / suggestion strings for which you do not understand all or part of the text, and you
cannot understand enough to rate. This includes query / suggestion strings which are completely or partially in a language
foreign to the language of the workflow in which you are rating (Latin or non-Latin characters). In the English US market,
you may skip queries/suggestions with multiple languages.
This does not include query / suggestion strings which are recognizably sensitive. If the text string is sensitive (eg. video
porno"), DO NOT skip, even if it is in a foreign language. In other words, if you can recognize that the string is sensitive, then
rate it sensitive.
In order to consider whether a query / suggestion is foreign, only look at strings longer than 3 letters. If the string is a
partial word, or only a few characters long, do not assume it is foreign. Keep in mind that some languages frequently use
words with 3 letters or less. For example, in Dutch you may see words with 2 or 3 letters like "al", "nu", die", etc, which
could be prefixes to English words.
Examples for when to skip and when not to skip
• Skip for non-Latin character foreign language

• Skip for unicode text
o eg. \u0d38\u0d4d\u0d38\u0d4d \u0d2f\u0d4d
• Skip for random string of numbers, without context
oe.g. 65063686
Do not skip for foreign language strings which are recognizably sensitive
