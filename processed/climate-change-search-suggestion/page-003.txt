Climate Change Integrity Discussion
August 21, 2019
When I searched for "climate change" yesterday on FB, 2 of the 3 autocomplete
suggestions are very misleading.
In general, do our policies combatting the spread of misinformation on Facebook apply to
climate denialism?
In specific, do we have any policy or mechanism in place that would remove these
misleading suggestions? Search suggestion algorithms seem like a pretty high-leverage
target to people trying to manipulate public opinion, so we should have some protections
in place against someone "google bombing" FB search.

any idea if we've tackled this for the TA?

we don't currently incorporate climate change in our TA labeling
guidelines. looking at Implementation Standards, climate change does not
explicitly violate policy either (though this may fall under misinfo and we'd
need to clarify Search's policy on this)

do we have anywhere we currently track all the things not in our current
guidelines and implementation standards? would make for a good backlog
prioritization discussion at some point.
