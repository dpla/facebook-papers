FYI I am proposing the following regexes to Wordy block (will wait for policy
approval):
(.climate change/climate change.).
• (global warming global warming.).
• (#globalwarming|#globalwarming.).
(#climatechange/#climatechange.).
(#climatereality|#climatereality.).
to turn off suggestions/hashtags related to global warming or climate change
except the exact match.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
