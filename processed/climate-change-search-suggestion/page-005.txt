Overview
Workflow Goals & Context
This document serves as the guideline for all TypeAhead Integrity rating flows. Integrity flows aim to improve the quality of
the Facebook Typeahead module by labeling text strings which populate based on a query the user enters into the search
bar. As a rater, your goal is to identify whether or not the string is sensitive, and if so, assign a sensitive label based on
the categories and criteria outlined in the guideline.
