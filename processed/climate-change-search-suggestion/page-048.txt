FYI I am proposing the following regexes to Wordy block (will wait for policy
approval):
• .(.climate change/climate change.).
• .l.global warming global warming.).
• (#globalwarming/#globalwarming.).
(.#climatechange/#climatechange.).
.(.#climatereality|#climatereality.).
to turn off suggestions/hashtags related to global warming or climate change
except the exact match.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
