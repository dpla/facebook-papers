NFX Reporting
Dislike and NFX reports are down -1.5%-2% and 2% respectively; interestingly, we saw
dislike rates down significantly the first few days, which means that users in the holdout were
disliking a lot more content than usual. It does seem that perhaps people get used to what
appears in Feed though (or perhaps they stop showing up to FB).
