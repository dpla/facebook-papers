MSI
MSI does seem to be hit by Integrity. Non-message given MSI started out elevated but has
since dropped ~0.6%. It's unclear if this is due to an explicit launch or if there was A/A bias
and / or novelty effects. But generally, I think it's safe to say that non-message given MSI is
down 0.2%-0.6% in production as compared to the holdout.
