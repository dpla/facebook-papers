tradeoffs between Integrity and Engagement
MAP + DAP
MAP and DAP are pretty flat. The metrics started out in the red but have been steady since
with MAP even increasing ever so slightly. I think the initial drop was just A/A bias and don't
think Integrity has much impact on these metrics.

DAP has been flat but once again, the red is probably just A/A bias.
