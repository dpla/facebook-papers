A First Look at the Minimal Integrity
Holdout
MONDAY, APRIL 29, 2019. READING TIME: 12 MINUTES
a
We started the Minimal Integrity Holdout about a month ago, and sufficient time has passed
to evaluate our impact on Integrity metrics, engagement, and the general user experience. In
a few weeks, once we have completed the initial run of surveys for Bad Experiences, we will
also be able to comment on any perceived differences in the reach of bad experiences on the
platform as a result of Integrity's efforts.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
All comparisons are made relative to the holdout population so if a metric is up,
it is higher in production as compared to the holdout, and if a metric is down, it
is lower in production as compared to the holdout.

We started the Minimal Integrity Holdout about a month ago, and sufficient time has passed
to evaluate our impact on Integrity metrics, engagement, and the general user experience. In
a few weeks, once we have completed the initial run of surveys for Bad Experiences, we will
also be able to comment on any perceived differences in the reach of bad experiences on the
platform as a result of Integrity's efforts.
All comparisons are made relative to the holdout population so if a metric is up,
it is higher in production as compared to the holdout, and if a metric is down, it
is lower in production as compared to the holdout.
TLDR
Integrity efforts have been focused on bad link experiences and it shows in the results of
the holdout--clickbait and ad farms are down 20-40% and generally OBCs are down
10%+.
• What's telling is that we have minimal impact on non-OCQ types of bad like borderline
N&P, borderline hate, and borderline violence and other types of negative experiences.
We need to establish criteria and guidelines around fairness, filter bubbles, and other
unintended consequences of ranking so that we can deal with these more sensitive
issues in a positive way.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
. Given that Integrity is changing a ranking algorithm that is optimized for engagement, it
is not surprising that Integrity has some negative engagement impact on engagement.
Generally, Integrity shifts away from public content, i.e. links and page content, and
toward friend content. The regressions on top-line metrics are not huge, generally on
the order of 10-30 bps for sessions, MSI, time spent, and VPVs, with no impact on DAP
and MAP.

OCQ Offenses
Let's kick things off with OCQ. Given that we demote Clickbait and Ad Farms quite a bit, it's
not surprising that when you remove these rules, prevalence is heavily impacted. Generally,
prevalence is -2% right now, and it rises to -2.5%-3% for withholding / exaggeration in the
holdout and to -2.5% for weak ad farm (strong ad farm is ~0.1% right now so it's hard to say
much about that).

For Engagement Bait, we are revamping the label-based prevalence delta pipeline but the
predicted prevalence delta from Deltoid is 15%. It's also worth noting that these Deltoid
deltas line up pretty nicely with the label-based versions.

Misinformation (Tautological Measurement)
The holdout still applies hard demotions and RO demotions. The only way to measure
our impact on Misinformation is with the predicted misinfo metrics, which
basically just measure our impact on content that is being demoted so this is
highly tautological. I'm mentioning it for completeness but I don't think we have
as great of an idea as to how we impact Misinformation as OCQ.
As expected, when you don't demote on something in the holdout, you see an impact on the
content that is not being demoted. For links, we have two versions of the metric, one that is
binarized (violating) and one that is continuous (expected). The drop in VPV prevalence is
between 2 and 9%, while the drop in OBC prevalence is higher at 17%.

Hate Speech / Borderline Hate
The holdout still applies hate speech and graphic violence demotions in at-risk countries, but
none exist outside of those.
We seem to be having a small impact in many language-country pairs on Hate Speech and
Borderline Hate, probably -3%, but this is an indirect effect of our other demotions.

Reach
a
Caveat: Reach of Bad Experiences remains a WIP in Integrity and we are still finalizing the
exact thresholds used to say that a user had a bad experience for some integrity concept. The
definition used in this analysis is simply 1 VPV on a piece of bad content. So the exact values
of this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt.
That said, 11% of users see content that has been marked as disturbing every day; 16% of
users see content that is likely to be bullying; 39% of users see hateful content (i.e. borderline
hate); 32% of users see borderline 3+ nudity content. These are significant proportions of
DAP and we have effectively no ranking interventions in place to mitigate this. Rather, our
impact is limited to OCQ offenses and Misinformation.

In the holdout, we see that users are exposed to disturbing / violent content, N&P, Bullying
and Hateful content, as well as, to a lesser degree, most OCQ offenses; however, when we see
what our impact has been, it is almost exclusively on OCQ offenses, which are not the most
severe harms. I believe strongly that this needs to change.

What blocks work on these types of sensitive issues?
• Concerns over fairness?
. Concerns over filter bubbles?
These are important questions, and we do not have ways to really measure these concepts
right now, at least they are not in widespread use. We need to develop concrete criteria for
these important concerns, and then we need investment to build out evaluation for these
criteria. Until we have that, we will likely struggle to make progress in high-harm spaces.
User Experience
Changes in Content
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
What's most clear from the holdout is that Integrity shifts the type of content seen
dramatically. There's more friend content and less public content.
Specifically, page content is down 4.5%

NFX Reporting
Dislike and NFX reports are down -1.5%-2% and 2% respectively; interestingly, we saw
dislike rates down significantly the first few days, which means that users in the holdout were
disliking a lot more content than usual. It does seem that perhaps people get used to what
appears in Feed though (or perhaps they stop showing up to FB).

Engagement
By definition, Integrity is going to cause some engagement regression as we are interfering
with the ranking provided by Relevance which is more or less trying to optimize for
engagement. I will describe the regressions below as well as try to roughly quantify the
tradeoffs between Integrity and Engagement (
MAP + DAP
MAP and DAP are pretty flat. The metrics started out in the red but have been steady since
with MAP even increasing ever so slightly. I think the initial drop was just A/A bias and don't
think Integrity has much impact on these metrics.

MSI
MSI does seem to be hit by Integrity. Non-message given MSI started out elevated but has
since dropped ~0.6%. It's unclear if this is due to an explicit launch or if there was A/A bias
and / or novelty effects. But generally, I think it's safe to say that non-message given MSI is
down 0.2%-0.6% in production as compared to the holdout.

App Performance
As expected, Integrity has infra costs. We should probably deprecate models that are not

Closing Thoughts
I will continue to monitor this holdout for some time and will report on the results of the
North Star Metric surveys which will attempt to capture the perceptions of users w.r.t. bad
experiences.
The big takeaway for me is we need to act on non-OCQ offenses and do so in a principled
way. Borderline content is not necessarily bad and shouldn't be driven to o, but there are
situations where our users do not want to see it and where it does not do anyone good to see
it. We need to model those situations and find ways to show users high-quality content that
will serve them in the long run.

Thanks for reading!

Pne thing I learned is for certain metrics, one single demotion might dictate its direction. For example, we are
deprecating an old signal, si_dec_abusive@page, which has very strong effects on many of the top-line metrics. This rule
should've overwrite the positive effects of many other smaller launches. That's why we need to frequently audit the list of
demotions we have.

I assume the borderline hate and hateful impact here is on posts and not comments, right? Our holdouts
show something like 40%+ drops on borderline hateful comments

Does 'VPV gt 50' mean hate as defined by a classifier score greater than 50?

Yes (although 50 means 0.50), so there are deltoid metrics of this type for various thresholds (0.5,
0.8, 0.85, 0.9, and 0.95) for the graphic violence, borderline hate, and hate speech classifiers.

For my understanding: This relates to holdout of people -- right? So, I wonder how virality impacts these
numbers. If the holdout is a small percentage, then a successful clickbait headline might work well for the holdout -- but it
has a much harder time becoming viral. So I assume that the real impact of the demotion is higher for things that are
highly dependent on viral growth. Is that right? And if so, can this be corrected for?

Yes that intuition is correct and this analysis does not account for downstream impact; we are
working to account for that in integrity metrics and to measure that in our holdouts. Will keep you posted when we
have something there. is leading the charge here and porting over some of the downstream work that
Relevance has pioneered.

It's not documented publicly unfortunately, but the gist is we are removing clickbait rules, ad farm
rules, engagement bait rules, broad trust, hqe, soft demotions. I can share specifics privately. Will ping.

you could use this experiment for your project? Though the treatment is a mix of lots
of atomic treatments so I'm not sure this will help untangle causal relationships.
