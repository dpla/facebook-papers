. Given that Integrity is changing a ranking algorithm that is optimized for engagement, it
is not surprising that Integrity has some negative engagement impact on engagement.
Generally, Integrity shifts away from public content, i.e. links and page content, and
toward friend content. The regressions on top-line metrics are not huge, generally on
the order of 10-30 bps for sessions, MSI, time spent, and VPVs, with no impact on DAP
and MAP.

OCQ Offenses
Let's kick things off with OCQ. Given that we demote Clickbait and Ad Farms quite a bit, it's
not surprising that when you remove these rules, prevalence is heavily impacted. Generally,
prevalence is -2% right now, and it rises to -2.5%-3% for withholding / exaggeration in the
holdout and to -2.5% for weak ad farm (strong ad farm is ~0.1% right now so it's hard to say
much about that).
