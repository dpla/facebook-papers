Closing Thoughts
I will continue to monitor this holdout for some time and will report on the results of the
North Star Metric surveys which will attempt to capture the perceptions of users w.r.t. bad
experiences.
The big takeaway for me is we need to act on non-OCQ offenses and do so in a principled
way. Borderline content is not necessarily bad and shouldn't be driven to o, but there are
situations where our users do not want to see it and where it does not do anyone good to see
it. We need to model those situations and find ways to show users high-quality content that
will serve them in the long run.
