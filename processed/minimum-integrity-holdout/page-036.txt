Engagement
By definition, Integrity is going to cause some engagement regression as we are interfering
with the ranking provided by Relevance which is more or less trying to optimize for
engagement. I will describe the regressions below as well as try to roughly quantify the
tradeoffs between Integrity and Engagement (
MAP + DAP
MAP and DAP are pretty flat. The metrics started out in the red but have been steady since
with MAP even increasing ever so slightly. I think the initial drop was just A/A bias and don't
think Integrity has much impact on these metrics.
