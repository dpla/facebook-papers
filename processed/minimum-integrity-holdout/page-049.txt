Pne thing I learned is for certain metrics, one single demotion might dictate its direction. For example, we are
deprecating an old signal, si_dec_abusive@page, which has very strong effects on many of the top-line metrics. This rule

demotions we have.

For my understanding: This relates to holdout of people -- right? So, I wonder how virality impacts these
numbers. If the holdout is a small percentage, then a successful clickbait headline might work well for the h
