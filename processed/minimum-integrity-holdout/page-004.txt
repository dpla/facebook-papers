OCQ Offenses
Let's kick things off with OCQ. Given that we demote Clickbait and Ad Farms quite a bit, it's
not surprising that when you remove these rules, prevalence is heavily impacted. Generally,
prevalence is ~2% right now, and it rises to -2.5%-3% for withholding / exaggeration in the
holdout and to ~2.5% for weak ad farm (strong ad farm is 0.1% right now so it's hard to say
much about that).
