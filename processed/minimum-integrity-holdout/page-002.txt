We started the Minimal Integrity Holdout about a month ago, and sufficient time has passed
to evaluate our impact on Integrity metrics, engagement, and the general user experience. In
a few weeks, once we have completed the initial run of surveys for Bad Experiences, we will
also be able to comment on any perceived differences in the reach of bad experiences on the
platform as a result of Integrity's efforts.
All comparisons are made relative to the holdout population so if a metric is up,
it is higher in production as compared to the holdout, and if a metric is down, it
is lower in production as compared to the holdout.
TLDR
Integrity efforts have been focused on bad link experiences and it shows in the results of
the holdout--clickbait and ad farms are down 20-40% and generally OBCs are down
10%+.
â€¢ What's telling is that we have minimal impact on non-OCQ types of bad like borderline
N&P, borderline hate, and borderline violence and other types of negative experiences.
We need to establish criteria and guidelines around fairness, filter bubbles, and other
unintended consequences of ranking so that we can deal with these more sensitive
issues in a positive way.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
. Given that Integrity is changing a ranking algorithm that is optimized for engagement, it
is not surprising that Integrity has some negative engagement impact on engagement.
Generally, Integrity shifts away from public content, i.e. links and page content, and
toward friend content. The regressions on top-line metrics are not huge, generally on
the order of 10-30 bps for sessions, MSI, time spent, and VPVs, with no impact on DAP
and MAP.
