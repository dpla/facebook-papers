In the holdout, we see that users are exposed to disturbing / violent content, N&P, Bullying
and Hateful content, as well as, to a lesser degree, most OCQ offenses; however, when we see
what our impact has been, it is almost exclusively on OCQ offenses, which are not the most
severe harms. I believe strongly that this needs to change.
Integrity Impact for Reach is Limited to OCQ Offenses and Some Misinformation
