A First Look at the Minimal Integrity
Holdout
MONDAY, APRIL 29, 2019. READING TIME: 12 MINUTES
a
We started the Minimal Integrity Holdout about a month ago, and sufficient time has passed
to evaluate our impact on Integrity metrics, engagement, and the general user experience. In
a few weeks, once we have completed the initial run of surveys for Bad Experiences, we will
also be able to comment on any perceived differences in the reach of bad experiences on the
platform as a result of Integrity's efforts.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
All comparisons are made relative to the holdout population so if a metric is up,
it is higher in production as compared to the holdout, and if a metric is down, it
is lower in production as compared to the holdout.
