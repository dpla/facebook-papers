Reach
a
Caveat: Reach of Bad Experiences remains a WIP in Integrity and we are still finalizing the
exact thresholds used to say that a user had a bad experience for some integrity concept. The
definition used in this analysis is simply 1 VPV on a piece of bad content. So the exact values
of this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt.
That said, 11% of users see content that has been marked as disturbing every day; 16% of
users see content that is likely to be bullying; 39% of users see hateful content (i.e. borderline
hate); 32% of users see borderline 3+ nudity content. These are significant proportions of
DAP and we have effectively no ranking interventions in place to mitigate this. Rather, our
impact is limited to OCQ offenses and Misinformation.
