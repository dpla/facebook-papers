For Engagement Bait, we are revamping the label-based prevalence delta pipeline but the
predicted prevalence delta from Deltoid is 15%. It's also worth noting that these Deltoid
deltas line up pretty nicely with the label-based versions.

Misinformation (Tautological Measurement)
The holdout still applies hard demotions and RO demotions. The only way to measure
our impact on Misinformation is with the predicted misinfo metrics, which
basically just measure our impact on content that is being demoted so this is
highly tautological. I'm mentioning it for completeness but I don't think we have
as great of an idea as to how we impact Misinformation as OCQ.
As expected, when you don't demote on something in the holdout, you see an impact on the
content that is not being demoted. For links, we have two versions of the metric, one that is
binarized (violating) and one that is continuous (expected). The drop in VPV prevalence is
between 2 and 9%, while the drop in OBC prevalence is higher at 17%.
