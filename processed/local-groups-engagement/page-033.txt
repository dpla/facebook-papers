1. Peoples' demand for local groups has been saturated: they're already in enough groups, and don't want to be in
more groups
2. Even if we have more inventory, we don't surface that inventory to people. (le, the problem is lower down in the
funnel.)
3. The incremental local groups are not the types of local groups that people have demand for (this is the hypothesis
suggested in my earlier comment).
I'd love your thoughts

eally interesting insights! Couple of thoughts
• on user density being negatively correlated with engagement: similar to
s comment above, but maybe
these communities are engaging in real life more easily, meaning that they don't have to engage online as much.
. Given that population density in rural areas is much lower, does having the same threshold for local groups (p75 to
centroid of 25km) make sense? These groups would probably be a lot smaller, making it less likely users will engage.

added thought: what were the feature importances of the model you trained?

thought I've mentioned it in the post, 128 and friend count are the most important
features.

to my second point: one way of seeing if the centroid difference needs to be changed would be by
comparing high school class groups in rural areas vs urban. Since school assignment in the US is mostly based on
geographic proximity, the ratio of the average distance between the two could be a good proxy for how much wider
the "local" radius needs to be in different parts of the country.

that's a cool idea"! I think though to keep this analysis simple, it suffices to count local
groups with two radiuses, and allow the model "choose" according to user density.
(*though, there's quite a bit of problems with school data, ask me how I know)
