Are local groups bad for engagement?
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2019 - READING TIME: 7 MINUTES
In this note I present four loosely connected results stemming from one analysis:

1. Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns

Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns
I've started my analysis with a goal of finding sub-populations underserved by the current
groups ecosystem. My thinking was that by finding such clusters of low engagement, we
might be able to create or promote the creation of groups dedicated to those populations.
Hopefully, such a concentrated effort will be more effective in identifying inventory-gaps.
a
The groups connect team segmented the population of FB users in the following way:
1. Luddites - People that are not active in groups, and are unlikely to become active even
if we tried our hardest. Technically - people that are not members of any active group,
having 17<=2 and either don't have a profile picture or have joined Facebook more than

a year ago.
2. No - People that are not members of any active group (and are not Luddites)
3. Light group users- People that are members of 1 to 10 active groups, and their group
128 is no more than 7 days.

4. Medium group users - Best defined as people that are not any of the other segments
5. Heavy group users - People that are members of at least one active group, and their
group 128 is at least 14 days.
With that definition, I filtered out all Luddites, and plotted in the next map the other
segments. The more red the color, the more likely that the people living in that "pixel" to be
in either the Medium or Heavy segments.

Likelihood of being in the Heavy/Medium user segments (Luddites are filtered)
It's not super surprising to see that groups-engagement, like overall FB-engagement is very
much dependent on geography. Still, it's interesting to note that the effort led by the groups
connect team, to push NO/Light users into more engaged segments, means as a matter of
fact, focusing on some specific countries.

In the US - city dwellers are less engaged in groups
Focusing on the US, one thing is apparent, even in the map above - people living near the
coast are less engaged with groups in comparison to people living in the heartland. Zooming
in on Texas reveals another interesting pattern:

The big population areas are less engaged with groups than the peripheries. We can see it in a
more objective way in the following graph, plotting likelihood of engagement (and likelihood
of being MP) as a function of user density:

exposed to GYSJ, though the correlation is not as strong as in the above graph.

Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of
group engagement
Given that user-density is correlated with group engagement, a natural follow-up question is
how much can we predict group-engagement given only user demographics features. Or
more succinctly - can we predict group engagement without using any group
related features?
Surprisingly the answer for US based users is yes. Given only user demographics
features, group engagement and MP status can be predicted with high accuracy.
This result (which was known to some people) is interesting on its own - it suggests that the
efficacy of our efforts to make people more engaged, or to create more meaningful people, is
somewhat limited by demographics.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Specifically we define two classification tasks:
1. Is a US user in the High/Medium user segments (versus the No and Light ones, ignoring
Luddites)?
2. Does a US user have a meaningful connection with any group - that is, are they
meaningful people.

1. Is a US user in the High/Medium user segments (versus the No and Light ones, ignoring
Luddites)?
2. Does a US user have a meaningful connection with any group - that is, are they
meaningful people.
As features I use the following - li, 17, 128, number of friends, nearby user density, facebook
age, age, gender and mobile OS. Note again that I don't include any features related to
groups, like "number of groups that is user is member of”. I fit a GBDT for the two tasks,
without
any fine tuning or metaparameter search (just sklearn's defaults).
When predicting user segment, the model gets AUC=0.81, meaning given two random users,
one is highly engaged with groups, one is not, we'll be able to identify which is which 81% of
the times. The accuracy is 73%, while a constant model would get 51%. L28 and friend count
are the most important features.
Predicting MP is a bit harder, but we still get AUC=0.79. The accuracy of the model is 74%,
while a constant model would get a 67%.

The number of local groups near a person is negatively
correlated with engagement
Finally, let's look at whether more local groups is better for engagement. Obviously, given
that user-density is negatively correlated with engagement, we can expect that local group-
density is negatively correlated with engagement. That is, in big cities, there are many local
groups, but users are less engaged.
To control for user-density and other demographics factors, I use the following procedure:
1. Take the classifier described in the last section and for a new set of users predict
"baseline" engagement probability, without knowledge of the number of nearby local
groups.
2. Train a new classifier (logistic regression), using the baseline probability from (1) and
the (log) number of active local groups near the user, trying to predict engagement.
3. Observe the weight the model gives to the number of active local groups.
[technical note - by active local groups I mean public or closed, non BSG, groups whose p75
distance from their centroid is less than 25KM, and having at least 3 distinct users posting or
commenting in the last week. We're counting how many such groups are within 25KM of the

I started this analysis hoping that I will be able to identify unengaged sub-populations, that
will benefit from us creating more local groups dedicated for them. I conclude with a somber
realization that this might be too optimistic, and being engaged with groups is not as strongly

I was actually thinking the same thing, but also maybe that other online options (Meetup,

My intuition is that other online options such as Meetup, Neighborly, etc. are too small to
account for the majority of the difference. If I recall correctly, the population penetration for those products is quite
low and the time spent per DAP is also low. I haven't tried quantifying that though. Would be super interesting to see
the total TS for competing online products vs the FB Group delta between city vs non-city.

is that U.S. Nextdoor users are much less likely to be rural vs. FB overall in U.S. (https://fburl.com/daiquery/5197hv8h).

Good point!
When doing the same procedure just to predict No users, there's still a positive correlation between number of local-

everything we see here.

Super interesting analysis! I wonder if the reason for this effect is that people in cities have a different
demand for different types of groups. Eg, people in rural areas might have a high demand for general neighborhood groups
(we know this from research!), while people in cities have a higher demand for organization, interest, and identity x local
groups.
I'd be interested to see this analysis broken down by group type to confirm this (I don't think we have a good existing model
to predict if a group is local interest, identity, organization, culture, or neighborhood, which might make it tough). I'd expect
to see that rural areas have high demand for neighborhood groups, while cities have high unmet demand for local x

Seems like although group engagement is much lower in coastal areas, group
inventory is still and only growing in there while being stagnated in the rest of US. So I suspect the longitudinal
trajectories of group inventory and group engagement may show a more positive sign for coastal US than a static

thoughts i might have on an instagram groups-map you mean?

Right, or some instagram-equivalent to the idea that local content production isn't correlated with
engagement.

Seems like although group engagement is much lower in coastal areas, group
inventory is still and only growing in there while being stagnated in the rest of US. So I suspect the longitudinal
trajectories of group inventory and group engagement may show a more positive sign for coastal US than a static
snapshot.

but if inventory is uncorrelated with engagement, then this wouldn't be the case, no?

if all group inventory (not just local group inventory) is uncorrelated with group engagement, then
yes. I thought this note is focused on local group inventory. Usually inventory and engagement has a positive
correlation and then saturates. I am not sure if coastal cities have reach the saturation point.

I thought your graphs are showing local group inventory

oh nah. It is the total group inventory from user_metrics_history.

One more hypothesis for this: our local group recommendations are the bottleneck, not
inventory.

can you explain this theory? too many local groups, so we recommend bad ones?

If more local group inventory isn't causing people to engage more with those groups, then either:
1. Peoples' demand for local groups has been saturated: they're already in enough groups, and don't want to be in
more groups.
2. Even if we have more inventory, we don't surface that inventory to people. (le, the problem is lower down in the
funnel.)
3. The incremental local groups are not the types of local groups that people have demand for this is the hypothesis
suggested in my earlier comment).
I'd love your thoughts,

really interesting insights! Couple of thoughts
on user density being negatively correlated with engagement: similar to
s comment above, but maybe
these communities are engaging in real life more easily, meaning that they don't have to engage online as much
. Given that population density in rural areas is much lower, does having the same threshold for local groups (p75 to
centroid of 25km) make sense? These groups would probably be a lot smaller, making it less likely users will engage.

thought I've mentioned it in the post, 128 and friend count are the most important
features.

to my second point: one way of seeing if the centroid difference needs to be changed would be by
comparing high school class groups in rural areas vs urban. Since school assignment in the US is mostly based on
geographic proximity, the ratio of the average distance between the two could be a good proxy for how much wider
the "local" radius needs to be in different parts of the country.

that's a cool idea"! I think though to keep this analysis simple, it suffices to count local
groups with two radiuses, and allow the model "choose" according to user density.
(*though, there's quite a bit of problems with school data, ask me how I know)
