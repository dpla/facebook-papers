The number of local groups near a person is negatively
correlated with engagement
Finally, let's look at whether more local groups is better for engagement. Obviously, given
that user-density is negatively correlated with engagement, we can expect that local group-
density is negatively correlated with engagement. That is, in big cities, there are many local
groups, but users are less engaged.
To control for user-density and other demographics factors, I use the following procedure:
1. Take the classifier described in the last section and for a new set of users predict
"baseline" engagement probability, without knowledge of the number of nearby local
groups.
2. Train a new classifier (logistic regression), using the baseline probability from (1) and
the (log) number of active local groups near the user, trying to predict engagement.
3. Observe the weight the model gives to the number of active local groups.
[technical note - by active local groups I mean public or closed, non BSG, groups whose p75
distance from their centroid is less than 25KM, and having at least 3 distinct users posting or
commenting in the last week. We're counting how many such groups are within 25KM of the

user
In both the user-segment task, and in the MP prediction task, the number of nearby local
groups is actually having a negative weight, which is significantly below o. Obviously, I'm not
claiming that more local groups cause less engagement with groups overall - this is just a
correlation. But, I am now skeptical of any efforts to increase the number of l Chats
