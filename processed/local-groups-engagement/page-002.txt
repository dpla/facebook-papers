Are local groups bad for engagement?
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2019 - READING TIME: 7 MINUTES
In this note I present four loosely connected results stemming from one analysis:
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
1. Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns
2. In the US - city dwellers are less engaged in groups
3. Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of group engagement
4. The number of local groups near a person is negatively correlated with
engagement
