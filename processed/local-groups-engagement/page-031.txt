Right, or some instagram-equivalent to the idea that local content production isn't correlated with
engagement.

Seems like although group engagement is much lower in coastal areas, group
inventory is still and only growing in there while being stagnated in the rest of US. So I suspect the longitudinal
trajectories of group inventory and group engagement may show a more positive sign for coastal US than a static
snapshot.

but if inventory is uncorrelated with engagement, then this wouldn't be the case, no?

if all group inventory (not just local group inventory) is uncorrelated with group engagement, then
yes. I thought this note is focused on local group inventory. Usually inventory and engagement has a positive
correlation and then saturates. I am not sure if coastal cities have reach the saturation point.
