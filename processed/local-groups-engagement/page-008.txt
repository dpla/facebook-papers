The big population areas are less engaged with groups than the peripheries. We can see it in a
more objective way in the following graph, plotting likelihood of engagement (and likelihood
of being MP) as a function of user density:
high engagement

0.60
055

Probability of engagement in groups vs. user density

This brings up some questions and a few possible explanations.
a
for example is working
on a more substantial analysis linking group engagement with social capital. I won't try to
fully explain why people in big cities are less engaged with groups. I'll note though that user
density is also negatively correlated with overall 128 at Facebook and likelihood of being
exposed to GYSJ, though the correlation is not as strong as in the above graph.
