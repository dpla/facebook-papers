Super interesting analysis! I wonder if the reason for this effect is that people in cities have a different
demand for different types of groups. Eg. people in rural areas might have a high demand for general neighborhood groups
(we know this from research!), while people in cities have a higher demand for organization, interest, and identity x local
groups.
I'd be interested to see this analysis broken down by group type to confirm this (I don't think we have a good existing model
to predict if a group is local interest, identity, organization, culture, or neighborhood, which might make it tough). I'd expect
to see that rural areas have high demand for neighborhood groups, while cities have high unmet demand for local x
something groups. (cc
for this hypothesis.)
Second hypothesis: people in cities use other apps instead of Groups, like Meetup, Eventbrite, and Reddit. (cc
for this hypothesis.)

what do you mean by "map for Instagram"? Because Instagram doesn't have the
analogous Groups product... If we were just looking at DAP or Time Spent I would surely do better in the coastal
areas.
