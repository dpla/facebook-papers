This brings up some questions and a few possible explanations. for example is working
on a more substantial analysis linking group engagement with social capital. I won't try to
fully explain why people in big cities are less engaged with groups. I'll note though that user
density is also negatively correlated with overall 128 at Facebook and likelihood of being
exposed to GYSJ, though the correlation is not as strong as in the above graph.
Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of
group engagement
Given that user-density is correlated with group engagement, a natural follow-up question is
how much can we predict group-engagement given only user demographics features. Or
more succinctly - can we predict group engagement without using any group
related features?
Surprisingly the answer for US based users is yes. Given only user demographics
features, group engagement and MP status can be predicted with high accuracy.
This result (which was known to some people) is interesting on its own - it suggests that the
efficacy of our efforts to make people more engaged, or to create more meaningful people, is
somewhat limited by demographics.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Specifically we define two classification tasks:
1. Is a US user in the High/Medium user segments (versus the No and Light ones, ignoring
Luddites)?
2. Does a US user have a meaningful connection with any group - that is, are they
meaningful people.
