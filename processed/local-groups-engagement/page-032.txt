thought your graphs are showing local group inventory

oh nah. It is the total group inventory from user_metrics_history,

One more hypothesis for this: our local group recommendations are the bottleneck, not
inventory.

can you explain this theory? too many local groups, so we recommend bad ones?

If more local group inventory isn't causing people to engage more with those groups, then either:
1. Peoples' demand for local groups has been saturated: they're already in enough groups, and don't want to be in
more groups.
2. Even if we have more inventory, we don't surface that inventory to people. (le, the problem is lower down in the
funnel.)
3. The incremental local groups are not the types of local groups that people have demand for this is the hypothesis
suggested in my earlier comment).
I'd love your thoughts,

really interesting insights! Couple of thoughts
on user density being negatively correlated with engagement: similar to
s comment above, but maybe
these communities are engaging in real life more easily, meaning that they don't have to engage online as much
. Given that population density in rural areas is much lower, does having the same threshold for local groups (p75 to
centroid of 25km) make sense? These groups would probably be a lot smaller, making it less likely users will engage.

added thought: what were the feature importances of the model you train
