Would love to hear from you
and
why people in big cities are less
engaged with groups! (even an initial set of hypotheses which still need proving out)

Does this relate at all to the Facebook app in flyover states vs. coastal correlation with
sessions/TS/DAP?

"flyover states" is a true coastal elite phrase

My hypothesis is that people in cities have compelling offline alternatives to whatever value FB
Groups provide. But that seems a bit simplistic.

I was actually thinking the same thing, but also maybe that other online options (Meetup,
Neighborly, etc) work better for higher population density areas.
has any of your research on competitors looked into City vs. Rural usage that would validate/invalidate
this hypothesis? If this is true, it opens up an entirely new area of work

My intuition is that other online options such as Meetup, Neighborly, etc. are too small to
account for the majority of the difference. If I recall correctly, the population penetration for those products is quite
low and the time spent per DAP is also low. I haven't tried quantifying that though. Would be super interesting to see
the total TS for competing online products vs the FB Group delta between city vs non-city.

Agree w/ that competitors aren't driving the difference, but still helpful to look at. What we see
is that U.S. Nextdoor users are much less likely to be rural vs. FB overall in U.S. (https://fburl.com/daiquery/5197hv8h).
We've also seen that overall FB app (or I don't have Groups) usage (L7, sessions) is stronger on average
when users are also using Nextdoor. Again, my interpretation is that it's not about a specific competitor, but does
speaks to our having really strong PMF in less dense areas in U.S.
