1. Luddites - People that are not active in groups, and are unlikely to become active even
if we tried our hardest. Technically - people that are not members of any active group,
having 17<=2 and either don't have a profile picture or have joined Facebook more than
a year ago.
2. No - People that are not members of any active group (and are not Luddites)
3. Light group users- People that are members of 1 to 10 active groups, and their group
128 is no more than 7 days.

4. Medium group users - Best defined as people that are not any of the other segments
5. Heavy group users - People that are members of at least one active group, and their
group 128 is at least 14 days.
With that definition, I filtered out all Luddites, and plotted in the next map the other
segments. The more red the color, the more likely that the people living in that "pixel" to be
in either the Medium or Heavy segments.
