Specifically we define two classification tasks:
1. Is a US user in the High/Medium user segments (versus the No and Light ones, ignoring
Luddites)?
2. Does a US user have a meaningful connection with any group - that is, are they
meaningful people.
As features I use the following - li, 17, 128, number of friends, nearby user density, facebook
age, age, gender and mobile OS. Note again that I don't include any features related to
groups, like "number of groups that is user is member of‚Äù. I fit a GBDT for the two tasks,
without
any fine tuning or metaparameter search (just sklearn's defaults).
When predicting user segment, the model gets AUC=0.81, meaning given two random users,
one is highly engaged with groups, one is not, we'll be able to identify which is which 81% of
the times. The accuracy is 73%, while a constant model would get 51%. L28 and friend count
are the most important features.
Predicting MP is a bit harder, but we still get AUC=0.79. The accuracy of the model is 74%,
while a constant model would get a 67%.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
The number of local groups near a person is negatively
correlated with engagement
Finally, let's look at whether more local groups is better for engagement. Obviously, given
that user-density is negatively correlated with engagement, we can expect tha
