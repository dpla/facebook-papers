In this note I present four loosely connected results stemming from one analysis:
1. Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns
2. In the US - city dwellers are less engaged in groups
3. Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of group engagement
4. The number of local groups near a person is negatively correlated with
engagement
Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns
I've started my analysis with a goal of finding sub-populations underserved by the current
groups ecosystem. My thinking was that by finding such clusters of low engagement, we
might be able to create or promote the creation of groups dedicated to those populations.
Hopefully, such a concentrated effort will be more effective in identifying inventory-gaps.

The groups connect team segmented the population of FB users in the following way:
1. Luddites - People that are not active in groups, and are unlikely to become active even
if we tried our hardest. Technically - people that are not members of any active group,
having 17<=2 and either don't have a profile picture or have joined Facebook more than

2. No - People that are not members of any active group (and are not Luddites)
3. Light group users- People that are members of 1 to 10 active groups, and their group
128 is no more than 7 days.
