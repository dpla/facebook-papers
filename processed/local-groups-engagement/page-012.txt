In both the user-segment task, and in the MP prediction task, the number of nearby local
groups is actually having a negative weight, which is significantly below o. Obviously, I'm not
claiming that more local groups cause less engagement with groups overall - this is just a
correlation. But, I am now skeptical of any efforts to increase the number of local groups in
hopes of increasing engagement. Following this analysis, I believe that the number of
local groups available to the user is uncorrelated with the user's engagement.

Closing Notes
I started this analysis hoping that I will be able to identify unengaged sub-populations, that
will benefit from us creating more local groups dedicated for them. I conclude with a somber
realization that this might be too optimistic, and being engaged with groups is not as strongly
correlated, at least in the US, with available inventory.
