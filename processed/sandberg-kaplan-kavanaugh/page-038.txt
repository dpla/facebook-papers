I just came across the Women's Leadership Day 2019 invitation in my feed. The
symbolism of WLD has never rung more hollow to me. It feels like a sham in light
of recent events.

"Some feel that they are unable to express their views, especially if they aren't
shared by those who have been most vocal and most passionate in these past
weeks." You had mentioned this during one of your segments during the talk, and
I'm still very confused. Could you please clarify? When speaking on the topic of
sexual assault, what are these views which people are unable to express?
Especially given the latter clarification of "All of us at Facebook stand firmly
opposed to sexual assault", which you had also said during the townhall?

Examples might include people who think the evidence is inconclusive and
we should apply presumption of innocence, or perhaps people who agree
with the post Boz apologized for. I would be shocked if it included
aberrations from opposition to sexual assault.

I'm a registered Republican and I stand firmly opposed to sexual assault. Yet
the first half of the previous statement has gotten me more than a fair few
looks of disdain when I share it with people.

Thank you for the response. Can you please clarify though,
again specifically regarding sexual assault, how does party affiliation
matter? I understand in general the climate is polarized and terrible but
separate from what I'm asking for clarification on. In what way is bringing up
political affiliation relevant to sexual assault?

Sorry, to clarify (I usually keep my responses short/snarky because I don't
like to discuss shit over the Internet; feel free to ping me or even schedule a
VC after if you want some more debate):
