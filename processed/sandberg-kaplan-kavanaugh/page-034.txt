They could have asked him not to get more involved with
parties and so on... If Kavanaugh is such a great friend he should
understand Joel's situation, right?

I agree that leadership could ask but it seems like he is in a supreme
position of power to deny those asks. He knows he can't be fired because of
how it would reflect on the company, so essentially he is free to do what he
wants.

And this is the problem at the core. Someone can do a shitty thing, knowing
they are protected by their position in an organization, and they get away
with it. The rest of us are stuck as victims.

Supporting a friend who you believe to be innocent is
not "a shitty thing." A large, large portion of the company disagrees with this
characterization. I believe that majority of the company disagrees with it and
finds Joel's actions to have been reasonable and understandable. I believe
the majority of the company doesn't want him to leave his current position.

I think a lot more people take issue with the "believe to be innocent"
portion of things than you're appreciating. Again, I do not understand how
good faith assessments of all of facts available leave one with a positive
view of Kavanaugh. There isn't enough evidence to convict him in court but
more than enough to show him to be a liar. A seeming unwillingness to
grapple with that and assume the accusing party is the liar is what is a shitty
thing.

That's your opinion, and one which a very large number of employees
disagree with. Disagreeing with this point does not make anyone "shitty."
