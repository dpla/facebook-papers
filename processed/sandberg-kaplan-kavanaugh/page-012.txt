To be clear, I don't think personal loyalty should be valued above all else
(there have to be lines), but I also have a really hard time with the idea that
you should abandon a long-time friend even if that friend is credibly
accused of horrible things. You might not like that your friend did it, or
support the behavior (obviously), and you may well support your friend
being punished for those acts, but they're still your friend, and you stand by
your friends. To mis-quote Trainspotting, "[Kavanaugh] is fucking psycho,
but he's a mate, you know, so what can you do?"
I much more strongly feel that your employer should have absolutely no say
in who you interact with socially, or who receives the benefits of your
political activities.

Thanks for clarifying. I think this explains a major part of the disconnect
between people on both sides of the Kavanaugh problem.
For me, growing up in a large city and being able to find and choose friends
among millions of people and thousands of acquaintances has made
distancing from a friend much less of a deal for both sides, compared to
when both of you are part of a small community (be it a small town or a
circle of elites), and don't have the room to stay away, nor other people to
become friends with.
It is still painful to lose friends over principles, but it is an entirely different
equation when excommunication doesn't imply exile.

I think everyone wants to move on and stop thinking about this situation. But it
doesn't mean it won't be a problem again in the future and I'm a little worried
about it. The healing is not guaranteed, we need to work on it.
