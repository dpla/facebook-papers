Thank you for the response. Can you please clarify though,
again specifically regarding sexual assault, how does party affiliation
matter? I understand in general the climate is polarized and terrible but
separate from what I'm asking for clarification on. In what way is bringing up
political affiliation relevant to sexual assault?

It's not.

Sorry, to clarify (I usually keep my responses short/snarky because I don't
like to discuss shit over the Internet; feel free to ping me or even schedule a
VC after if you want some more debate):
I think the fact that you implied that "...some may feel they are unable to
express their views...", some/most/all/few (?) of whom are Conservatives
and/or Republicans with those same people who think sexual assault is A-
OK is what I and some others who commented on this are pointing out as
being a bit over the top.

Thank you for clarifying. I in no way intended what you're
saying I've implied. That is in fact the root of my entire confusion. Twice now
we have Sheryl, in the same statement, saying "everyone is against sexual
assault" and "people are afraid to express their beliefs". Exactly like you said
short of a bad faith assumption, these are non-sequiturs to me. I don't
understand why they're connected, but someone must feel that they are for
this point to be called out both in the live talk as well as this repost. Which is
why I'm asking.

i think the problem is that people are afraid to voice their
beliefs because it gets another meaning attached to it. For example: "I am
happy that brett kavanaugh is confirmed" gets attacked as "I support sexual
assault".
