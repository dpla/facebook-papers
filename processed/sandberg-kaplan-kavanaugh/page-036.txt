A preponderance of heavily left news outlets and writers
_believe_ he is lying. Without providing convincing evidence.
Look, I don't even like the guy. I don't personally care for him. But if your
argument is that believing he is innocent is factually, objectively impossible,
the facts of the case do not back you up at all, regardless of your emotions
or opinions on the matter.

REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
That's a convenient out for you, but I can assure you I'm
acting in good faith. I just disagree heavily with you and am sticking to hard
facts instead of my opinions or beliefs.

I agree that Joel should not be fired. Not only because of the PR nightmare
that would cause. He is perfectly fit to be in charge of our relationship with
the Republican Party. He is however very obviously biased in favor of that
party and that disqualifies him from leading our entire policy efforts in US
and even more so around the world. We need someone else, biased or not,
to be put in charge our relationship with the Democratic Party, and another
Chats
