Some feel - and I have been surprised by the number of people who are
telling me this privately - that they come to work to focus on their jobs not
debate social issues and they feel increasingly that they are unable to do so
I see the phrase "bring your authentic self to work" thrown around a lot at
Facebook
1. Is this phrase an official FB tenant, policy or written as part of our culture? Or
is it just something that has sprouted as part of our "unofficial" culture over
the years?
2. Can we really have a "bring your authentic self to work" culture and not be
expected to be involved in debate around social issues (or any issues that
affect us on a personal level)? I just see these as diametrically opposed to
each other. Or is there a subset of "bring your authentic self to work" that I
do not understand?
I ask these questions in all seriousness because I would like to know the answer
to understand the baseline of what bringing your authentic self to work actually
means.

FYI this was asked during the town hall and answered by Sheryl

Oh. I was unable to watch the entire town hall. So I must have
missed that. I guess there is a rerun tomorrow. Maybe the answer there will
satisfy my search for knowledge.

The answer, if I remember correctly, was "we're working on that and aren't
completely sure where the line is" so it's something we still need to work on
collectively for sure. It's something Sheryl/leadership feels is extremely
important, but obviously there's a line somewhere between where we are
and 'noxious behavior', but it's hard to pin down exactly where that line
should be.
