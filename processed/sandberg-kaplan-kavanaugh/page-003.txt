Wait, how is attending the hearing a mistake, but attending a public swearing-in
ceremony for him is not? Aren't they both unnecessarily injecting Facebook into a
contentious national debate? What did I miss?

I think the logic is you can't go and cheer one side from the
bleachers, but once a winner has been announced, you're free to celebrate
the outcome (even if half the people watching think the ref was biased). Eg
the debate is over so it's not contentious anymore. Not sure I agree that this
is a fair reflection of the reality of this situation, though.

I had the same reaction. I'm not sure if I'm slow or I just disagree. Either way,
it's not clear to me from this post why these are clearly different in terms of
OK-ness.

I think this is the logic, and I think that logic is totally wrong.

I think what added to the sensitivity of the hearing was that
it was about sexual assault allegations, not whether he was generally
qualified for the job.

For the company, we see a distinction between attending a controversial
public hearing about sexual assault on the one hand which we agree was a
mistake, and on the other hosting a gathering at your home and attending a
swearing-in ceremony for a confirmed Justice and close personal friend.

I see a meaningful distinction between the home gathering & the others (private
vs. public), but the hearing and swearing-in seem like comparable events.
It seems like whatever principles made appearing at the hearing a mistake (e.g.
optics for FB of a VP publicly taking a side in a politically contentious event)
