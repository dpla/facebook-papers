Fair enough, thank you for clarifying as well!

i think the problem is that people are afraid to voice their
beliefs because it gets another meaning attached to it. For example: "I am
happy that brett kavanaugh is confirmed" gets attacked as "I support sexual
assault".
William stating that he is a republican gets shifty looks because people are
attaching their own worst case opinions about what republicans might
believe, not because of any of his actual views.

Thanks Sheryl Sandberg. I just don't agree at all that it was appropriate for Joel
to attend a celebration party after these contentious hearings. My stepsister,
Deborah Katz, is Dr. Fords lawyer so I have personal accounts of this whole
episode. If Joel knew all of the negative reactions from attending the hearing in
such a high profile way, he certainly should not have attended this party. He is
very much a public figure for Facebook, and I feel he has done the company a
great disservice!

He didn't just attend it, he hosted it.

Brazenly supporting his friend of 20 years whom he
reasonably believes to be innocent.
