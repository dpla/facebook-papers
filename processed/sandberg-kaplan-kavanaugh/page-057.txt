I do think we are talking past each other. Apologies, didn't
mean to strawman you.

I apologize to you too. I know this is hurtful to more in the company than just
myself. I hope you have a good day.

appreciate your kind words, it's certainly a difficult and
sometimes hard-to-follow discussion for everyone. I apologize again.

Thank you Sheryl Sandberg for this message. It is a very complex situation and I
appreciate the clear direction in your statement. I agree with your decision, and in
no way it sponsors anything but other than respecting someone's personal
relationships in an important appointment for this nation. There is a lot of work
ahead of all of us to make a difference for everyone. Thank you again

Sheryl Sandberg, this and the other messaging from m-team so far has read as
"I'm an ally but..." which feels as effective and sincere as starting an apology with
"I'm sorry but...".
Society will have a hard time evolving for the better so long as we continue to
tolerate and encourage support for not only sexual assault but also abhorrent
personal behaviors like Kavanaugh has demonstrated. With your defenses of Joel,
you are publicly aligning yourself with that side of the equation. I am personally
disappointed because I expected your voice to be the brave one that balances
out angry yelling from abusers.
