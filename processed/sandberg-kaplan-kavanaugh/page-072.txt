My initial disappointment with this post stemmed from feeling like it was not
actually answering the important, deeper questions in concrete ways. I think it's
important to understand that asking hard questions that demand meaningful
responses takes time and effort. I really hope people don't see this post as an
invitation to simply "move on" from the issue but instead move *into* the issue in
more deliberate, thoughtful ways.
We are a company of smart people. We are capable of having difficult
conversations with kindness and understanding, regardless of political
differences or different life experiences. I hope we are brave enough to do this
instead of ignore the issues. We can't afford to when we're building such
consequential products for such a diverse user base.

I'm curious, what deeper questions haven't been thoroughly addressed?

I believe this mindset is as useful for how we approach product problems as
how we approach culture problems.
