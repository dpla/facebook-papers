Sheryl Sandberg Employee FYI
October 8, 2018.
...
Hi everyone. I want to address the questions that are being asked about Joel's personal and
professional activities this week.
Before I do that, I want to acknowledge that many people are upset in our company. Some feel
that we have not adequately addressed the pervasiveness of sexual assault in the world and
how position and privilege plays into society's failure to prevent assault and abuse. I am
grateful to those who raised their voices on this, especially those who have shared their
personal experiences. Some feel that leaders are treated differently from other employees at
Facebook. Some feel that they are unable to express their views, especially if they aren't
shared by those who have been most vocal and most passionate in these past weeks. Some
feel - and I have been surprised by the number of people who are telling me this privately -
that they come to work to focus on their jobs not debate social issues and they feel
increasingly that they are unable to do so.
I want to say upfront that we do not have perfect - or even adequate - solutions for all of
these concerns today and many of these issues will be with us for years to come. I want
everyone to know that Mark and I and our other leaders hear these concerns. We are
committed to doing the long-term work to build a culture where we can advance our mission,
better serve people who use our products, and provide a safe and productive work
environment for everyone here. We have a company filled with dedicated, passionate people
who have deep beliefs and that makes us better. We are at a moment where social polarization
in our society is deeply impacting all of us and our workplace. We have work to do and ways
we need to change. But we can be a workplace where everyone - survivors, people with
conservative and liberal political views, and people who don't want to discuss social issues -
feel safe and empowered to do their work. We can be a workplace that continues to support
people with diverse points of view. We are committed to finding a way to get there.
Mark and I have both said that Joel's attendance at the Kavanaugh hearing on sexual assault
was a mistake because it unnecessarily injected Facebook into a contentious national debate.
All of us at Facebook stand firmly opposed to sexual assault, a position that as someone said
at the Town Hall is so basic and obvious it should go without saying. We believe that. We have
also said that we made mistakes in not acknowledging the issue of sexual assault raised by
this hearing and the effect of this debate on many employees. We held Friday's Town Hall to
give this important issue more space, while recognizing that one meeting can't fully address
something so serious.
This weekend, Joel and his wife hosted the Kavanaughs and some friends at their home. Later
today, Joel will attend the public swearing-in ceremony along with all of the Supreme Court
Justices and many members of the US Senate. While Joel did not talk to me or Mark abou
attending the hearing, he told us about both of these subsequent events and we support

This weekend, Joel and his wife hosted the Kavanaughs and some friends at their home. Later
today, Joel will attend the public swearing-in ceremony along with all of the Supreme Court
Justices and many members of the US Senate. While Joel did not talk to me or Mark about
attending the hearing, he told us about both of these subsequent events and we support his
decision to participate. For the company, we see a distinction between attending a
controversial public hearing about sexual assault on the one hand which we agree was a
mistake, and on the other hosting a gathering at your home and attending a swearing-in
ceremony for a confirmed Justice and close personal friend. Our decision to support Joel's
participation in the latter two activities reflects this distinction.
The reactions at Facebook to the events of the past two weeks mirror what is happening in
society at large. For people who see Justice Kavanaugh as a symbol of society's acceptance of
sexual assault and refusal to believe women, supporting Joel in attending events even after the
Town Hall is highly upsetting. For others, including many who have asked me to say this as
they feel they can't, Justice Kavanaugh is a jurist who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to be
a Supreme Court Justice and they support him and Joel's decision to attend.
This moment is hard for many employees and leaders at our company. As I said in the
beginning of this post, we have a lot to do to work through conflicting points of view and
create an inclusive community within Facebook where we come together to advance our

I would guess, given Facebook's reputation at this point, that a minority
percentage of the company is a celebrity, is friends with a celebrity, or is in a
circle with someone who is or will be a public figure very soon.

Wait, how is attending the hearing a mistake, but attending a public swearing-in
ceremony for him is not? Aren't they both unnecessarily injecting Facebook into a
contentious national debate? What did I miss?

I think the logic is you can't go and cheer one side from the
bleachers, but once a winner has been announced, you're free to celebrate
the outcome (even if half the people watching think the ref was biased). Eg
the debate is over so it's not contentious anymore. Not sure I agree that this
is a fair reflection of the reality of this situation, though.

I see a meaningful distinction between the home gathering & the others (private

This is worth noting, and I empathize with people who feel isolated or
alienated by the intense all-encompassing politicization of all topics, but at
the same time a different perspective might make the cost seem

Here's an example: if an employee of a large company during the civil rights
movement were to complain that they weren't able to focus on their work
due to the constant debate on social issues, I think most people nowadays
would consider that to have been a necessary cost paid to achieve better
rights for all Americans.
From my understanding, the present crisis is viewed this way: powerful
people (mostly older men) have different rules applied to them than the rest
of us (but particularly women). The perception is that if a woman were
accused of crimes similar to what Kavanaugh was accused of, she would not
have been given the benefit of the doubt that he was: different rules apply.

In a similar vein, many women have experienced sexual assault similar to
that described by Dr. Ford yet felt pressured to hide it, or faced extreme
doubt and derision while the perpetrators walked free from doubt or blame:
different rules again. Now we see that a member of our leadership attended
a heated political hearing, without notifying the company beforehand, yet
the impression is that the average employee would not be given such a
break for doing so: once again, a perception of different rules applying to
different people.
That's the crisis: the powerful (particularly men) getting away with things
the rest (particularly women) would have their careers (or even lives)
destroyed for
So you can see why some people might feel like now is a time that requires
breaking social norms on isolation of political discussion. The question is: in
40 years, will this period be seen as one of crucial change (as with the civil
rights movement and many others), incurring a cost of social stability in
order to transform society into something a little more tolerable?

any negative way. His delivering this message would convey that we hold this
principle even when the accused is our friend and even when we can't imagine
that the charge is true.
I urge that FB rise above charges of politics and make our principles clear in this
issue. Because not taking charges of sexual assault seriously means, in effect,
supporting sexual assault.
Thanks for your attention.

I've never read something from leadership that rung so hollow.
If he had given you prior notice, why didn't you share that previous to the town
hall? You had every opportunity to get ahead of this.
If you believe this is truly an issue, where is the action? The true measure of
values is not on the incessant issuing of statements but in the sum of actions
taken.
Why do you draw a false dichotomy between a crushing symbolic moment and
supporting a friend? I've had friends with serious problems and the way I support
them is by helping them be a better person - not throwing them a kegger when
they make bail.
This isn't even about politics. We can all agree that women's rights are important,
leaders serving women's rights are important, and that you invite scrutiny into
your private life when you make it public yes? What giant failure of reasoning am I
making here?

Thank you for addressing this. And thank you, Mark and Sheryl, for engaging
actively at the town hall and continuing the conversation.
Respectfully, while I definitely agree that Facebook should not mandate who
anyone can and can't be friends with or host in their home, personally would
have rather Joel Kaplan not spoken at the town hall and delivered something
adjacent to an apology at all. If he's not sorry (as attending the swearing in
suggests) that's none of my business, but it feels like speaking there was a waste
of time for both the attendees and for Joel himself. If your apology is 1%
complete, the recipient is under no obligation to accept it. I'm also unsure why
you'd bother delivering it.

I think one of the things that is also upsettings is the idea that Mark and Sheryl
are less vocal regarding their opinions on this issue because of Joel's personal
relationship with Kavanaugh.
Mark I remember when you were tearful at the Q&A following Trump's election.
Your words acknowledged that we are a diverse company implying rightfully we
employ conservatives and Trump voters) but your tone and emotion showed
solidarity with those deeply hurt by his election. I've seen the same thing from
Sheryl on various issues. The company line may be one thing but you've usually
signaled to us how you really feel on something.
The nuts and bolts of the Kavanaugh situation have not really been discussed but
I think they are relevant, which is that I truly do not understand how anyone
making a good faith assessment of the situation can come to the conclusion that
this is an honest person (happy to link 1000 articles) who we can feel good about
being one of nine people to direct the future of the nation and its citizens. I
understand if you're close friends with someone defaulting to their side. But
taking that side means saying the accuser is a liar. People are hurt because our
leaders are supporting that viewpoint as legitimate "both sides" situation. I wish
we could at least hear from our leaders their personal views as candidly as Joel
has expressed his. I do not believe either of you believe this is as grey as people
are making it out to be, and that's hurtful.

I see the phrase "bring your authentic self to work" thrown around a lot at
Facebook
1. Is this phrase an official FB tenant, policy or written as part of our culture? Or
is it just something that has sprouted as part of our "unofficial" culture over
the years?
2. Can we really have a "bring your authentic self to work" culture and not be
expected to be involved in debate around social issues (or any issues that
affect us on a personal level)? I just see these as diametrically opposed to
each other. Or is there a subset of "bring your authentic self to work" that I
do not understand?
I ask these questions in all seriousness because I would like to know the answer
to understand the baseline of what bringing your authentic self to work actually
means.

As someone who both comes from a background in which personal loyalty is
highly valued and is deeply suspicious of the power that corporations have over
their employees, I'm happy to see that we're not taking an official stance on the
people with whom our employees can interact.
I think that Brett Kavanaugh is a terrible choice for the Supreme Court for a
number of reasons, not least of which is his apparent propensity for sexual
assault, but I in no way think that Facebook should be deciding which people its
employees, regardless of level and position, are able to maintain social
relationships with.

Thanks for clarifying. I think this explains a major part of the disconnect
between people on both sides of the Kavanaugh problem.
For me, growing up in a large city and being able to find and choose friends
among millions of people and thousands of acquaintances has made
distancing from a friend much less of a deal for both sides, compared to
when both of you are part of a small community (be it a small town or a
circle of elites), and don't have the room to stay away, nor other people to
become friends with.
It is still painful to lose friends over principles, but it is an entirely different
equation when excommunication doesn't imply exile.

Doing so on FB@work, requires people to be able to express those differing

If you're convinced that it's hard, unproductive or impossible the next best

A thought exercise for those who'd rather not discuss social issues of sexual
assault at work, which you're totally entitled to do:
Facebook as a company takes a number of public, declarative stances on social
issues: gender equality, LGBTQ rights, pro-democratic, pro-free speech. Let's say
you disagreed with one or more of those stances-would you just brush it off, or
are you co-signing those positions by working here?
I encourage empathy from the 'just want to work' position, for those who feel

The statement above to me is counter to our ability to achieve our mission
of bringing the world closer together. We have to build with empathy and
without it, I'm not sure we'll ever achieve our mission. Rather debating social
issues, understand them. Many issues are lived experiences not only of

We can't be naive in thinking that social issues don't matter, or play a part in
products we build, or create biases for so many who suffer from a lack of
privilege or allyship because of the said statement above. I really hope we
can come together as a global community and build an inclusive community.
But to do so, we can't downplay important issues like this one amongst so

I'm not sure I understand this point. For those who diverge from
the FB consensus on social good, many do 'brush it off' while at work. The
outrage over Joel's actions made it seem as though even 'brushing it off' -
and acting on their own prerogative privately - is not allowed. While I'd
happily co-sign the broad values you mentioned above, I certainly don't
want employment here to be interpreted as co-signing specific FB stances
on social or political issues. Are you suggesting we should feel that way?

While it certainly is a luxury to "just focus on work", for some, this is a job
earned thru a lot of hard work - and they don't have the luxury of being a
very 'in-demand' engineer or sales person, who can afford to spend time at
work championing social issues. There is always a cost - and the cost of
spending hours on workplace debating social issues or attending town halls
is working by hours at night ... landing diffs, taking away those hours from
one's children or spouse... or the actual social communities we all belong to.
So in a way, debating social issues at workplace itself is a luxury just as
much as not doing so is.
It is also surprising to me how quickly we jump to conclude 'oh, you don't
know how that feels.. you're one of those privileged kinds right? go enjoy
your luxury of i-dont-care' or 'if you are not raising your voice, you are
supporting it'. That mentality championed by the twitter and reddit
community is why I, for one, don't frequent those communities until it's
fixed. That is a horrible and unsafe situation. I'm fine with working at a
leftist/liberal organization which doesn't necessarily reflect my opinion, but I
sure as hell won't want to work in a militant-leftist-liberal organization where
I will be judged for wanting to 'just work' or 'if you are not with us, you are
against us' mentality,
Yes, I do just want to focus on work. And also the stock price.

Genuine question. Can someone with this viewpoint explain to me how you are
forced to partake in the debate of social issues and not focus on work?
I mean, it would be decent since not all of your fellow employees have the luxury
to just focus on work. And also because if we are trying to build a product where
our users can have a constructive discussions and experiences then it should
ideally start with us the employees.
But with all these being said, you also have the prerogative to scroll past the

I'll bite. I won't repeat my comment above so feel free to scroll up and read

because of course as you said not everyone can just block it out and focus
on work. (Also blocking it out and focusing on work are not mutually
exclusive, nor is choosing not to participate in these workplace discussions
the same as blocking it out).
I do not exactly share Boz's sentiment - I particularly disagree with his
distinction between bringing one's authentic self with one's full self. I don't
believe this is possible for some people, especially minorities.
What I will say is this. These are multifaceted issues that are not 100% black
and white, do not personally feel that this forum is a safe space to discuss,
yet sometimes it feels almost obligatory because oftentimes lack of
participation is equated with apathy. I also think your sentiment of "oh you

I think it's pretty clear from my post that this does not represent my
sentiment. I was asking this as a question why the people who would rather
not even have these posts on workplace at all don't consider this as an
alternative, which you responded to.
Can you guys elaborate on why you feel lack of participation
is associated with apathy? I'm asking this because I feel like the large
majority of people at Facebook do not participate in these posts (some
because they do not consider this a safe place like you mentioned), and I
think it will be impractical to label every single one who didn't participate as
apathetic.
One of the people that messaged me privately said these posts trigger
painful memories that she would like to avoid and acknowledged her
privilege in being able to do so. I understand this and see this as a good
reason why someone may not want to see these posts on workplace.

Sheryl, I really respect you and what you stand for. I was touched by your
vulnerability at Pride Leadership Day earlier this year; I'm relatively new around
here and with all of the storms we've faced as a company, your leadership has
been something for me to look for to make sure we were going to be okay.
That being said, I find this all very disappointing. As a proud people manager,
hold myself to really high standards, including how I conduct myself in public and
what I post on my personal social media. Why? Because my grandfather has
always taught me to "remember who you are and what you represent" at all times.
I find it disappointing that the standards that all people managers here are held to
at FB aren't applied in this case. After Joel listened to all of the concerns at the
town hall last week, he still deemed it appropriate to celebrate all of this, with
disregard for the thousands of people at FB questioning his integrity as a leader in
a very important part of our business. I support his ability to have a personal life,
but I feel that comes with a price the higher up you get. It very much so feels like
Friday was theatre for him and he didn't listen to the frustrated voices that had a
moment to air their grievances. And that, to me, isn't authentic. I question his
ethics and his ability to lead this part of the business apolitically.
Thank you for creating a culture where we're able to be this open and
transparent. I hope we're all able to reason with each other in the future and learn
from this experience.

Calling out privilege is not name-calling, it is not belittling it shouldn't even
be offensive. Yet somehow in our social context acknowledging that
systemic bias exists and that some people are impacted and some are not is
somehow "fighting words". I would urge you to investigate what you're
bringing to this discussion and whether this is the most constructive thing
you could be doing right now to build the company you want to work in and
the world you want to live in. Pointing out privilege is not an attack- it is a
teaching moment. It is often the case that we cannot see our own privilege
so when someone points it out, use it as a moment to reflect on what you

this apology is for you too. I agree,
empathize with, and affirm everything said after
first sentence.
These are real people in the receiving end of systemic and institutionalized
discrimination, and part of our mission in connecting the world should be to
enable them to lobby/fight for justice through our forums. And that's how I
see the connection between my work as an engineer and social issues. In
that sense, there isn't separation between work and social issues, our work
should hopefully continue to address and solve some of these issues.
In light of this, please also listen to the problems being brought up by your
teammates, who are fighting hard for the same exact mission you are
lobbying for. This was what motivated my first response.
There is a growing sentiment that political debates, accusations, calling out
VPs in town halls for their personal actions, are distracting us from putting
our best effort towards this mission. *I know you disagree to this. But i ask
that you at least acknowledge that it is a growing sentiment.* And people
who hold this view, will really appreciate being able to do so without being
accused of exercising extreme privilege when we do so. We wouldn't have
brought it up if we didn't care deeply about the same work and mission you
care about. Yes, we are not able to fully empathize because we are not in
the receiving end of said hurt. But while at Facebook we should expect work
and social issues to heavily overlap, there is a need to recognize that
political issues are polarizing and divisive. There's unfortunately not a clear
separation between social justice and politics, making it such a hard topic to
navigate, with politics being thrown in the mix. Also, we also know that there
is basically a 50-50 split in ideologies in this country we are based in, and
most people you ask will agree that the ratio is more skewed to the left in
our employee demographics, so our demographic is already not so
representative of the general population. Which is why it is important that if
we want to "start with ourselves" in building an all inclusive community, it is
of my opinion that we need to less carelessly play the privilege card, using it

Hi
thank you for writing this response. I would like to build a
bridge and that must start with understanding. It seems you have mostly
understood my point- I cannot leave politics at home because politics will
not leave me alone. I cannot turn off the sides of my identity that make me a
target for systemic oppression. Whether I am at work or at home, when a
story breaks about another unarmed Black person shot and killed by police,
I immediately think of my own son and yes, it fully distracts me from work. I
cannot focus on work well in that moment. This is what I am referring to.
This is my lived experience.
I would now like to understand, and invite you to think through, what it is
that upsets you so much about being said to be exercising privilege in being
able to fully focus on work at work and not think about social issues most of
the time (until those of us who cannot do so interrupt that flow as is
happening now). Because you have used words like "accused" and
"character attack" to describe how it feels to have privilege pointed out, I
would like to understand what is behind this?
Is it because you did not mean to or realize you were exercising privilege?
That is often the way privilege works and it is not about intent. Is it because
you didn't ask for the privilege to do so and feel called out to be made to
account for something you can't control? That is also how privilege works-it
is unearned, often invisible advantages that when pointed out feel very
uncomfortable as they force us to rethink whether everything we have is
really ours and fairly earned. I get this is a painful realization. Is it because it
feels unfair to be said to be exercising privilege when you thought you were
just being you- super focused on work which seems to be something
anyone could do if they really wanted to- vs. what I am saying which is that
maybe it is worth considering that it is actually structurally easier for you to

that hurts" one. This is why I posted my comment in the first place. For
Sheryl and others who are asking her to voice this can reflect on what they
are really asking of their colleagues here by grieving the loss of a workspace
where social issues don't encroach on work. To me, that is not an
empathetic ask to make. We are really all just trying to survive in a
increasingly toxic and polarized space.

The key point you missed in my response: it is not a
privileged ask to not wish go too deep into debating politics in the
workplace, because it polarizes, divides, and distracts from the real mission
that both you and I care actually about - social justice. I hope you will read
my earlier comment more carefully, because i unpacked why it is so.

and not participate. Women have to participate every day. If you don't know what

One week ago, Joel Kaplan, VP of Global Policy, stated to Women@, "I want to
apologize for the fact that my presence at yesterday's hearing caused pain to
many of my colleagues...as a member of Facebook's leadership team and head of
our policy team I should have realized that my presence could be seen as
representing our company - and I am sorry for not getting that."
Today we are told that Joel attended the public swearing-in ceremony for Justice
Kavanaugh, but that we do not have a company position on any of this. We are a
platform and a company for all voices, so we are not taking a position either on
the specific selection of a Justice or on the general credibility of female victims
and their subsequent treatment in society.
Except, following from Joel's apology, we have taken a position. We were there
today, standing with a Justice, uplifting his values, celebrating his career, and
signifying that he is the one to be believed.
I'm unsure when we decided that the social calendar of one individual superseded
the feelings and lived experiences of a whole other swath of the company. What is
the moral philosophy we are trying to uphold here? I used to presume it was a
form of utilitarianism, or bringing about the "greater good for the greatest
number." Individuals are and were willing to make sacrifices, as many have
mentioned this past week, for the greater benefit of the company and it's
narrative. However, recent choices from our Leadership make me think that we
are now leaning towards a very different form of consequentialism, where the
"consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about
the rightness or wrongness of that conduct."
Justice Kavanaugh was sworn in. Joel Kaplan continues to do whatever he wants.
The women & allies of Facebook have, and continue to, suffer the consequences.
I urge us to consider alternatives.

more than enough to show him to be a liar. A seeming unwillingness to
grapple with that and assume the accusing party is the liar is what is a shitty

An organization must never make a goal of not being accused of bias. The

bias. All Facebook should do is provide evidence about bias, and ignore the
accusations. For a case study in failing at this, look at most any news

Nope. If you are the VP of Global Public Policy, you (1) talk to leadership in
advance (2) either resign first or very clearly separate yourself from the
company by issuing a public statement (3) if you don't do the above and
there's a huge uproar at the company that ends in a town hall where you
insincerely try to apologize and where many co-worker victims share their
painful stories, the least thing you do the day after that town hall is throw a
party to carry on doing what you've been told is bad for the company and
for many of your coworkers.
It's not about private VS public life. Also, Zuckerberg himself has said before
that people like him at Facebook are also accountable in their private life.
Heck, any of us is 100% accountable while wearing company swag and/or
clearly identifying ourselves as employees. That's taught in the bootcamp
training on day one.
VPs are not "just employees", so I highly disagree on that false dichotomy
and encourage you to reconsider your point of view. I agree with it for other
circumstances but in this case, it's very very clear that this is not what has
happened and everybody is trying to justify it in this simple way when it's
clearly not the case.

facing here something called a dilemma where nobody has the "right
reason", because it doesn't exists. So apart from saying our opinion, the
only thing we need to do is to respect other people points of view.
Let me put you a different analogy of a dilemma where there is no right
choice. Imagine that you are in a boat and there was an accident. People are
drowning and you need to decide between rescue the closest person to
your boat (only 1) or go a little bit further and rescue 5 people that are 50
meters from where you are. You know that saving both is impossible so you
need to choose something. In this situation, you may think that the logical
answer is to rescue 5 people over the 1 that is closest to you. However,
some people will tell you that they are unable to deny help to someone
asking for it. So some people will just save the closest one - assuming that
other 5 people will die and some people will go to save the 5 person group.
You can reason about one option is better than other but again, there is not
"right answer" because nobody is over any other person principles.
On here, even with the responsibility of Joe as a VP of Global Public Policy
at Facebook, he should not been considered guilty of what he did as he is
not accountable for other people mindset that without asking, assumed that
he was present on the act as a FB employee. A person can't be considered
guilty of the ignorance, lying or fake news on the media if they are wrong. If
people assume things without asking him personally, it is not his fault. It is
people/world fault for assuming a wrong occurrence.
I also don't like that he went to the event and celebrated it at his home with
a party the day after. I can share my point of view with him so he is aware, I
can argue with him and plan for future events, but ultimately, I need to
respect his actions.
Lastly, regarding your comment about Zuckerberg. Ultimately, you are the
person who can make the decision if you want to be representing your
company at all times or only in your business life. Unless it is explicitly said
in the contract that you can't attend X type of events or that you need to
ask for permission before going to public places (I suppose this is illegal or
nobody would sign it hehe). If not, you are the owner of your freedom of
doing whatever you want - as far as it is reasonable/legal/etc.
At least from my point of view, I am not accountable for nothing related with
facebook when I wear a Facebook T-shirt. As any person could have bought
it online for example. So I may go to a vegetarian protest

you cannot wear it if you want to attend somewhere on a personal basis.
This, I believe, is covered in the bootcamp. Same thing for certain
employees. At some level and especially at some position, like Joel's, you
represent the company at all times unless you clearly separate yourself and
make a very clear and public statement. That's why I don't agree with "this
is an opinion". It's not. CEOs and VPs / very public figures of companies are
different.
Finally, I understand your analogy but again, I neither agree with the
equivalence nor like scenarios that are arbitrarily picked to create an
impossible dilemma. As I said, if he really wanted to stay in the clear, there
was a very simple and direct path he could have chosen. And he knew it,
this is definitely not his first rodeo. Hence why I say what I say.

Two things about this:
1) This is dogfooding our product and our philosophies. So many of these
problems are due to us using fb/workplace at our core, and our philosophy of
'open and connected'. If we can't create a decent community capable of more
than 1 viewpoint, or involving any difficult topics, our public products never will.
2) Facebook products and decisions are so fraught with social issues and
implications I don't think anyone will ever be able to just "come and write code",
nor should you. The people building our infrastructure to delete ents have as
much impact on the social implications of our products as Leadership or the

Of course this kind of crime is difficult to prove without hard evidence (like

aspects of the story, like having attended the party in the first place.
Instead, the 2 non-perpetrators that could have, gave statements they have
no idea what she was talking about. Her ex's sworn statement pointing out
holes in her story (essentially, perjury) were also concerning.

I think treating "support" (or "enabling") as an all-or-nothing endeavor is
another contributor to divisive tribalism, though.
To use a more clear-cut scenario, there are many ways one might "support"
and/or "enable" a friend who's been charged with a crime: lend him money
for bail, donate to his legal defense, be there when he needs someone to
talk to, protest outside the courtroom. If he's acquitted: celebrate with him,
spread the news. If he's convicted: say goodbye, visit him in prison,
celebrate when he gets out, help him find a job and a place to live, vote for
him when he runs for mayor, help him raise money when he runs for
president, edit his Wikipedia page to remove all references to his past, etc.
But not all of those represent the same trade-off of personal loyalty vs.
principles.
Some of them are actually the principled thing to do: everyone deserves
competent legal representation, no matter what they're charged with, so the
verdict will be legitimate. Some are clearly unprincipled and unethical. And
some are emotional gestures that don't signal any endorsement of his
actions: you can feel sad for what your friend is going through while still
recognizing that it's because he screwed up.

Would you say sitting in the audience at a friend's hearing is an example of

party afterward? (I'd classify both as "supporting" only.)

I think it has a lot to do with tribalism. When we decide that being seen to
associate with someone would "support or enable" their past actions, that's
divisive: it slowly drives them out of our group and toward the closest one
that will accept them. They lose exposure to the values and ideas we
identify with, and become exposed to more of the ones we reject.
Meanwhile, we become more entrenched in our own views, reinforcing the
division and strengthening our tribal identity.

these events on their personal time (as long as they don't literally get up
and speak, which I agree is problematic). I think it's dangerous to invite
company scrutiny into our personal lives, or to throw out the rule of law
requiring the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
I know our visceral response to heinous crimes and natural empathy for
victims makes it difficult to presume innocence, but we need to understand
that throwing that out gives government free license to oppress and silence
any dissident (in other words, this could easily be turned around on you),
which would lead to the breakdown of a free society.

the point is well taken, however, I am merely pointing out
the precedent that has been established.
I think taking a post such as VP of Public Policy means that all your public
appearances now reflect on the company and not just you. Doesn't look my
point is going to come across without an example:
If I am the VP of public policy and need to make such an appearance for,
let's say an accused mass murderer, I would first resign from my post before
I attend it. Or at least take a public leave of absence or in some way publicly
disassociate my company, as remember, I would be the "public policy face".

You may like or may not like it but you need to respect it. It is exactly the

At the end, it is just point of views, nobody has the "reason" here. That he is
the VP of a company matters 0.

thanks for clarifying, though this still seems really extreme to
me (actually I didn't immediately grasp last week that some people see this
as Joel "representing Facebook" though I can understand why it is taken
that way now). I think a statement saying that he is there in a personal
capacity, not representing his company, would more than suffice. Especially
if, like I said, he's not speaking or referencing the company in any way.

Thanks for sharing this Sheryl. To address your point "Some feel that leaders are
treated differently from other employees at Facebook", why don't we have an
appeal process if we think our managers gave us a wrong rating? You said
everybody makes or have made mistakes, so if we are all equal in the company
why don't you change our policy? We are all human beings and mistakes can
happen, but if you are a leader, a manager, or a person of power it seems it is
ok...or else it is tolerated. This is another very sad moment for Facebook, and I am
disappointed to see that a company whose mission is "to give people the power
to build community", is on the contrary giving leaders the power to do whatever

There is an appeals process in the sense that feedback given is not final for
some time until after given to the employee. I've received feedback that was
in direct contraction with company values and policies. In one review I was
given plenty of time to show the contradiction and get it stricken from the
record.

was a "Meets All" review which remained a "Meets All" review. There was
paragraph on what I needed to improve, however, which I completely
disagreed with. This was several years ago so it's hard to remember the
exact text and there's no formal record because of my appeal.
The effect of the paragraph was, "Dean needs to not take risks in doing his
work." This wasn't specific to any failure of mine, in fact, in that half i
pushed Oculus forward substantially. Instead, it was clear from the wording
this was a cultural difference I had with management at the time. My work
was experimental and bold, and as such was disruptive but ultimately
necessary.
There was no support--for me the feedback was bad and inconsistent with
the company's value around being bold.

To label someone as privileged isn't the same as to villainize. That's an
important distinction to make up front.
Additionally, i think what we are discussing is not about the desire to focus
on work - it's about the ability to only focus on work. Some people are
actively grappling with private realities that make it hard to focus on the task
in front of them and it's exacerbated in times like these as it's hard to feel as
if the company (or the world) is working with you.
I desire for everyone to have that privilege. But it's not where we are.

Probably my last comment for awhile as I've talked way too
much on these threads and fallen way too behind...
Just want to add that on this topic, I've seen both men and women here try
to openly express the trouble they're having with their worlds colliding
between work and politics and their desire for an escape.
It's worth noting that 1) in most(not all)corporate settings, these issues are
kept very far away which doesn't offer many the experience of how to
handle these issues and
2) many people are new to FB and it's culture and we should consider that
it's reasonable for people to be uncomfortable with our level of openness on
these topics not having been in a similar environment.
It's more than fair that it can be viewed to some as a privilege to try ignoring
these issues, but I'd caution those that frame this solely based off the
assumption it's due to "privilege".
There are many issues that have directly effected me these past couple of
years, and I found myself spiraling when faced with trying to battle the
topics on my personal FB every day. It led to a very unhealthy mental state
and feelings of depression. There were times I needed to escape for my own
well-being...it doesn't mean it's right or help the cause, but I think people
should choose to what extent they'd like to participate.

I think people are assuming a little bit of bad intent on this one.
Sheryl says in the post that some people want to come to work to focus on
their job and they are increasingly feeling that they are unable to. This isn't
about only focusing on work, it's about having the ability to focus on work.
By all standards last week was extreme, probably for most of us. It's OK for
some people to express that and say they want less social and political
discussion at work. It doesn't make them privileged in my opinion.
At the same time it's totally OK for people who want to engage heavily and
open up to do so.
From everything in Sheryl's post I thought this is the least controversial
point and I was somewhat amazed it became a reason to criticize a big part
of the employees...

If we had a VP personally supporting David Duke
Bill Clinton would be a better example, honestly.

I will admit that after reading this post on a break and then going back to my
mandatory legal training, I came across this concise passage, which said, quite
ironically:
"While working for Facebook, you're expected to use your best judgment and
avoid conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest exists when your personal
interests interfere with the best interests of Facebook. This includes even the
appearance that you might be putting your interests ahead of Facebook's.
Most conflict of interest situations fall into one of four categories: personal
relationships, professional engagements, personal investments in other
companies, and giving or receiving gifts or other benefits. But this can be a grey
area."
...I find it a little hard to accept that this wasn't a violation of policy, regardless of
permission or intent. I mean, "personal relationships" is literally THE FIRST
example here. The double standard here is frustrating, but reperable, and I think
it's key that we hold ourselves - all of us - to the same standard. Especially if we
are going to go through a mandatory training in opposition to the behavior
discussed in this thread.

I just finished the training too, and I didn't get the impression
that sitting in the audience at a hearing would count as a violation. (Of
course, the advice it gives is to ask the Conflicts Committee first.)
In part, that's because the quoted passage doesn't mean everything that
falls into those categories is prohibited. It mentions a gray area, and the
following paragraph gives some examples of things that aren't included.
Overall, "conflict of interest" appears to be defined more narrowly than it
might seem from the general statements at the beginning.
For example, having a personal relationship with someone who works for a
competitor might be seen as a conflict of interest. But there are people here
whose partners or spouses work at Google.
Even the use of our own products could be seen as a conflict of interest. If
chat with my friends on Hangouts instead of pushing them to use
Messenger, one might argue that I'm putting my interest in not alienating my
friends ahead of Facebook's interest in growing Messenger -- but if that
qualifies, well, we're going to have a lot more empty parking spaces.
The standard for California employers is that employees have the right to
engage in personal activity while not at work by default. They can give it up
in a conflict-of-interest agreement, but only if it's "conduct that is actually
in direct conflict with the essential enterprise-related interests of the
employer and where breach of that contract would actually constitute a
material and substantial disruption of the employer's operation". I wouldn't
be so sure that this counts.
