I agree that Joel should not be fired. Not only because of the PR nightmare
that would cause. He is perfectly fit to be in charge of our relationship with

to be put in charge our relationship with the Democratic Party, and another
someone else, with an impeccable record of impartiality, to be put in charge
of our policy efforts in US and worldwide. Policy team should be
reorganized

of recent events.

shared by those who have been most vocal and most passionate in these past
weeks." You had mentioned this during one of your segments during the talk, and
