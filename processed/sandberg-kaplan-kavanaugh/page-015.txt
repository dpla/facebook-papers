My hope is that we use these (albeit painful) internal use cases to make big blue
an even better product that helps users have quality conversations with those
that have different views.

This. In a weird, twisted way we're dogfooding Facebook's ability to
moderate social turmoil and facilitate meaningful discussion

Amen to that Kyle, imagine if we're able to crack this, the good that it could
do.

The strategy as I understand it is to show people differing views so they
don't immerse themselves in conversations with people who agree with
them.
Doing so on FB@work, requires people to be able to express those differing
views in the first place.
If you're convinced that it's hard, unproductive or impossible the next best
thing is to cut down on the amount of discourse.

A thought exercise for those who'd rather not discuss social issues of sexual
assault at work, which you're totally entitled to do:
Facebook as a company takes a number of public, declarative stances on social
issues: gender equality, LGBTQ rights, pro-democratic, pro-free speech. Let's say
you disagreed with one or more of those stances-would you just brush it off, or
are you co-signing those positions by working here?
I encourage empathy from the 'just want to work' position, for those who feel
conviction around sexual assault and feel unsafe or under siege.
