That would be why I was careful to say "support and enable", not just
"support"
It's not even a third time you're misrepresenting my words,
Your
claim about my position being "all-or-nothing" is wrong, and as strawman
arguments go, not particularly useful: even if it were valid, it has nothing to
do with tribalism.

In my comment, I gave examples of both supporting and enabling. I'll edit it
to clarify
In this specific case with Kavanaugh, I'm not sure how that distinction
matters, but if it does, I'd like to understand it.
Would you say sitting in the audience at a friend's hearing is an example of
"supporting", "enabling", or both? How about inviting the friend to a private
party afterward? (I'd classify both as "supporting" only.)
third time you're misrepresenting my words
I don't agree with that characterization, but as I've said a few times now: if
you feel some important meaning isn't getting through in text, then why
don't we take the standard FB advice and discuss it offline? In my
experience, that's a good way to clear up miscommunication.

even if it were valid, it has nothing to do with tribalism
I think it has a lot to do with tribalism. When we decide that being seen to
associate with someone would "support or enable" their past actions, that's
divisive: it slowly drives them out of our group and toward the closest one
that will accept them. They lose exposure to the values and ideas we
identify with, and become exposed to more of the ones we reject.
Meanwhile, we become more entrenched in our own views, reinforcing the
division and strengthening our tribal identity.
