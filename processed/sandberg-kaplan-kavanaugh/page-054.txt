Hmmm this seems like an unfair assessment to me. I've been through some
of these trainings too, but they usually make allowances for friends and
family. I mean, we're not expected to dissociate from people we're already
close with.

"Some feel that leaders are treated differently from other employees at Facebook.
Some feel that they are unable to express their views, especially if they aren't
shared by those who have been most vocal and most passionate in these past
weeks. Some feel - and I have been surprised by the number of people who are
telling me this privately - that they come to work to focus on their jobs not debate
social issues and they feel increasingly that they are unable to do so."
If I was a powerful politician who didn't want to be held to account for how I used
my power I would be delighted with this framing.

You might be as well if you were a political, religious, or identity minority at
Facebook and saw how pile-ons often work in Workplace.

Nah - I'm a racial minority and this is the kind of framing used to advantage
minorities in power over minorities out of power.
I'm also a social conservative personally (though i vote differently) and I
don't get the sentiment here. Is it really so hard to respectfully voice a
dissenting opinion? Or is it because it's not so much a dissenting opinion,
but rather an opinion voiced aggressively or an opnion that seeks to take
others liberty
Let's case study this: I believe in the institution of marriage and think people
should take it seriously before they commit to it and should uphold the vows
where they have the power and circumstance to.

All about the Kavanaugh case is about fighting against
people that use their power to abuse of others, not the inverse!
