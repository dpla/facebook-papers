the moral philosophy we are trying to uphold here? I used to presume it was a
form of utilitarianism, or bringing about the "greater good for the greatest
number." Individuals are and were willing to make sacrifices, as many have
mentioned this past week, for the greater benefit of the company and it's
narrative. However, recent choices from our Leadership make me think that we
are now leaning towards a very different form of consequentialism, where the
"consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about
the rightness or wrongness of that conduct."
Justice Kavanaugh was sworn in. Joel Kaplan continues to do whatever he wants.
The women & allies of Facebook have, and continue to, suffer the consequences.
urge us to consider alternatives.

The hard part for me is what are the alternatives? We can't fire Kaplan
because that would be a PR nightmare. I suffer and can't figure out what
can be done.

for this very specific case, I don't think Joel should be fired.
However, I think after the repetitive choices he has made this week, even
after hearing feedback and seeing how his actions came across, he should
consider another role here. He suddenly seems unable or unwilling to make
the personal sacrifices needed to be the VP of Global Policy. As many have
mentioned, you don't face this level of scrutiny as an average IC. I hear we
are still hiring.

They could have asked him not to get more involved with
parties and so on... If Kavanaugh is such a great friend he should
understand Joel's situation, right?

I agree that leadership could ask but it seems like he is in a supreme
position of power to deny those asks. He knows he can't be fired because of
how it would reflect on the company, so essentially he is free to do what he
