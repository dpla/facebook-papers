jumping into this conversation to share my view. I believe that
your work is different that your personal life. You need to respect that Joe
decided to go within his personal life, as work can't constrain his freedom of
going on there.
You may like or may not like it but you need to respect it. It is exactly the
same that if he likes hot dogs and you are a vegetarian and you are against
killing animals for food. We just need to respect it.
At the end, it is just point of views, nobody has the "reason" here. That he is
the VP of a company matters 0.

thanks for clarifying, though this still seems really extreme to
me (actually I didn't immediately grasp last week that some people see this
as Joel "representing Facebook" though I can understand why it is taken
that way now). I think a statement saying that he is there in a personal
capacity, not representing his company, would more than suffice. Especially
if, like I said, he's not speaking or referencing the company in any way.

Thanks for sharing this Sheryl. To address your point "Some feel that leaders are
treated differently from other employees at Facebook", why don't we have an
appeal process if we think our managers gave us a wrong rating? You said
everybody makes or have made mistakes, so if we are all equal in the company
why don't you change our policy? We are all human beings and mistakes can
happen, but if you are a leader, a manager, or a person of power it seems it is
ok...or else it is tolerated. This is another very sad moment for Facebook, and I am
disappointed to see that a company whose mission is "to give people the power
to build community", is on the contrary giving leaders the power to do whatever
they want.
