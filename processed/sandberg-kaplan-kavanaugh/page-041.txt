Brazenly supporting his friend of 20 years whom he
reasonably believes to be innocent.

Yes, reasonably. If you don't believe that's a
reasonable position given the evidence, it's likely because your politics skew

On one side we have a woman who has everything to lose and nothing to
gain coming forward and credibly answering all the questions she was
asked.
On the other side we have a man who multiple friends from the time confirm
frequently was aggressive after drinking and blacked out, who denies it
happened in a disgraceful performance. The key witness, Mark Judge, did
not do a hearing or was interviewed by the FBI.
But sure, reasonable doubt.
Do my politics skew left? Sure, and one of the reasons is that people on the
left that have been credibly accused have just stepped down, as it should
be.

She's on the cover of Time Magazine, received half a
million dollars through GoFundMe, and had a chance to block a conservative
Supreme Court appointment that is currently one of the most hated figures
on the left, even before the accusations came out.
I don't believe her testimony was motivated by any of this, but some people
do. To claim she had nothing at all to gain is disingenuous.
I'm suggesting you are biased to the point that you can't assess the
situation objectively.
