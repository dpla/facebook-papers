No, not in and of itself. The disgust came from the more general unhinged
nature of it - crying over memories of his dad reading calendars, as if his
father had passed away (when in reality he was sitting a few rows over),
combined with the combativeness and lies.
But your point is well taken, and look, I get it. This is highly subject to
interpretation. I know that Republicans interpret this whole thing differently,
and like I mentioned earlier, intellectually I really do want our workplace to
be a place where people can all feel respected. I really do. If you feel
differently about Kavanaugh, that's okay - I want to still work with you, I
want to share openly with you and chat at happy hours and have everyone
evaluated the same at PSC time. I want to disagree but be cordial and
friendly. It's a particularly hard time to do that. I hope we can get through it,
together.

"I can't help but feel like we are going easy on him because we are excited
to have an executive who is best friends with a Supreme Court nominee. It
just feels gross."
Exactly how I feel. And yes. It's gross.

My hope is that we use these (albeit painful) internal use cases to make big blue
an even better product that helps users have quality conversations with those
that have different views.

This. In a weird, twisted way we're dogfooding Facebook's ability to
moderate social turmoil and facilitate meaningful discussion
