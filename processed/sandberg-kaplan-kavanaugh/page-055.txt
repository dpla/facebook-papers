but rather an opinion voiced aggressively or an opnion that seeks to take
others liberty.
Let's case study this: I believe in the institution of marriage and think people
should take it seriously before they commit to it and should uphold the vows
where they have the power and circumstance to.

All about the Kavanaugh case is about fighting against
people that use their power to abuse of others, not the inverse!

A very practical definition of power is the ability to unleash mass criticism at
work, to threaten someone's job, or to tell them to shut up at work.
That power has been used to silence those with minority ideas, beliefs,
religions, and identities in this case.
I'm glad that Sheryl seems to want to put a stop to that.

My friend, that's a very toothless definition of power because we have
Trump in the White House, a possible sexual assaultor nominated to the
Supreme Court, and his friend publically advocating for him with no
repercussions.
A very practical definition of power is the ability to drive real impact and that
largely stems from political, economic, and legal institutions. Claiming that
our protests - numerous as they may be - amount to the same (or seemingly
even more impactful) borders on gaslighting.

Power is situational and contextual. His definition of power is perfectly
reasonable. There is a vocal contingent of people at the company using
their position to silence others. That doesn't seem controversial to me. If
you try to change definitions to support your right to silence others, you
probably won't be surprised when people aren't okay with that.

As I state above, this isn't about silencing others. You are welcome to
