yes we are a tech company, but we are more importantly
a social company capable of making unprecedented social impact! Having
these debates about social issues in our case is actually essential to our
ability to make products that matter. Otherwise we will find ourselves
building products that are oblivious of societal realities and to Jose
Villalobos's point only products that cater to the few people who have the
luxury of never having to deal with these problems.

hope my meaning came through clearly-I was advocating for
solidarity and empathy, not against.

I'm not sure I understand this point. For those who diverge from
the FB consensus on social good, many do 'brush it off' while at work. The
outrage over Joel's actions made it seem as though even 'brushing it off' -
and acting on their own prerogative privately - is not allowed. While I'd
happily co-sign the broad values you mentioned above, I certainly don't
want employment here to be interpreted as co-signing specific FB stances
on social or political issues. Are you suggesting we should feel that way?

It did. I was adding on to your point. Totally agree.

all people are paradoxical in some ways, and it's both credible and
acceptable to privately hold opposing views to some or all our company's
stated positions. I'm not suggesting a specific outcome of your reflection or
your privately-held views to change-a thought exercise isn't a bludgeon
but a way to inhabit how others feel.
