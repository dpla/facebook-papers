> "come to work to focus on their jobs not debate social issues and they feel
increasingly that they are unable to do so.
Two things about this:
1) This is dogfooding our product and our philosophies. So many of these
problems are due to us using fb/workplace at our core, and our philosophy of
'open and connected'. If we can't create a decent community capable of more
than 1 viewpoint, or involving any difficult topics, our public products never will.
2) Facebook products and decisions are so fraught with social issues and
implications I don't think anyone will ever be able to just "come and write code",
nor should you. The people building our infrastructure to delete ents have as
much impact on the social implications of our products as Leadership or the
people working in washington.

While I agree, I hope you also see the paradox in what you are saying
though.
It's unrealistic to think we can come to office and completely, never, talk
about social issues. And it's also not possible spend all our time at our
desks, and in our public forums/town halls, on these debates and not have
time to discuss business and infrastructure issues. I think all of us find a
balance somewhere in the middle, but disagree on where exactly the
optimal balance should be found. And I think we should pay attention to the
growing opinion that says the current balance is skewed too far to one side.

I agree with your statements though I'm not sure I see a paradox, just a call
for balance

1. We should open and accommodating to all viewpoints
2. We should actively involved in discussing social issues.
The paradox is that we can't maximize 1. without compromising on 2., if
people have a viewpoint that we are focusing on 2. too much.
