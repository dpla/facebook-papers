Well I don't think we are going to come to agreement on the
privilege aspect of this. In order to make this discussion more constructive,
can you suggest the motive behind directly contacting Sheryl and how else
it will be possible for them to stay out of it without stopping the
conversation? I would have thought one can stay out of it by not
participating, something a lot of people are currently doing.

Maybe Sheryl solicited feedback and they didn't reach out to try to
stop it?
Maybe people around them kept on discussing it to the point it became
impossible to concentrate on work?
I don't know what the reason is but I definitely don't assume they tried to
stop this conversation completely.

no worries. You said in your original comment that you totally
get their position, so I wanted to understand some of that myself.

My initial disappointment with this post stemmed from feeling like it was not
actually answering the important, deeper questions in concrete ways. I think it's
important to understand that asking hard questions that demand meaningful
responses takes time and effort. I really hope people don't see this post as an
invitation to simply "move on" from the issue but instead move *into* the issue in
more deliberate, thoughtful ways.
We are a company of smart people. We are capable of having difficult
conversations with kindness and understanding, regardless of political
differences or different life experiences. I hope we are brave enough to do this
instead of ignore the issues. We can't afford to when we're building such
consequential products for such a diverse user base.

I'm curious, what deeper questions haven't been thoroughly addressed?
