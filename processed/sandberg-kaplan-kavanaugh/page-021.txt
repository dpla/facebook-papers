Some feel - and I have been surprised by the number of people who are
telling me this privately - that they come to work to focus on their jobs not
debate social issues and they feel increasingly that they are unable to do so.
Wow, pour one out for all the poor souls who have had disrupted the privilege of
going about their day unconcerned with such inconveniences as the fact that we
confirmed a man credibly accused of sexual assault to the highest court for life,
and the message of disrespect and mistrust it sends to women and survivors at
FB that this man is publicly celebrated by a top executive at our company with full
support from leadership.

Genuine question. Can someone with this viewpoint explain to me how you are
forced to partake in the debate of social issues and not focus on work?
I mean, it would be decent since not all of your fellow employees have the luxury
to just focus on work. And also because if we are trying to build a product where
our users can have a constructive discussions and experiences then it should
ideally start with us the employees.
But with all these being said, you also have the prerogative to scroll past the
posts and continue working? This comes off to me as an attempt to prevent
people from voicing their concerns.

Were I to guess, it would be the uptick in notifications in this and other
groups on the topic, and in invitations to all hands/town halls also on the
topic.
