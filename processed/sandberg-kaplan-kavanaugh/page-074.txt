I will admit that after reading this post on a break and then going back to my
mandatory legal training, I came across this concise passage, which said, quite
ironically:
"While working for Facebook, you're expected to use your best judgment and
avoid conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest exists when your personal
interests interfere with the best interests of Facebook. This includes even the
appearance that you might be putting your interests ahead of Facebook's.
Most conflict of interest situations fall into one of four categories: personal
relationships, professional engagements, personal investments in other
companies, and giving or receiving gifts or other benefits. But this can be a grey
area."
...I find it a little hard to accept that this wasn't a violation of policy, regardless of
permission or intent. I mean, "personal relationships" is literally THE FIRST
example here. The double standard here is frustrating, but reperable, and I think
it's key that we hold ourselves - all of us - to the same standard. Especially if we
are going to go through a mandatory training in opposition to the behavior
discussed in this thread.

REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
I would guess, given Facebook's reputation at this point, that a minority
percentage of the company is a celebrity, is friends with a celebrity, or is in a
circle with someone who is or will be a public figure very soon.
If we're required to state conflict of interests and activities with people and
events that could possible become news worthy, we'd end up paralyzed.
