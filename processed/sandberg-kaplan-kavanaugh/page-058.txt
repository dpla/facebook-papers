personal behaviors like Kavanaugh has demonstrated. With your defenses of Joel,
you are publicly aligning yourself with that side of the equation. I am personally
disappointed because I expected your voice to be the brave one that balances
out angry yelling from abusers.

Actually I thought it was pretty clear from all the messaging and the town
hall that no one here will "tolerate and support sexual assault."
Not everyone interpreted the Senate hearings or Joel's involvement the

because it is also a major component of the authoritarian mindset. I'm not

authoritarian, just that most people who support and enable authoritarians
use personal loyalty as moral justification.
