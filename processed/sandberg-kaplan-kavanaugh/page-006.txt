Sheryl,
As many said last Friday, this isn't about politics. And as you noted, "FB is against
rape" is pretty obvious (and therefore weak).
I request that FB tell the world that our principle is that all accusations of sexual
assault should be taken seriously and investigated in a fair and even-handed way.
No matter who the accuser is and no matter who is accused.
The best person to deliver that message is Kavanaugh's friend Joel -- and not in
any negative way. His delivering this message would convey that we hold this
principle even when the accused is our friend and even when we can't imagine
that the charge is true.
I urge that FB rise above charges of politics and make our principles clear in this
issue. Because not taking charges of sexual assault seriously means, in effect,
supporting sexual assault.
Thanks for your attention.

I've never read something from leadership that rung so hollow.
If he had given you prior notice, why didn't you share that previous to the town
hall? You had every opportunity to get ahead of this.
If you believe this is truly an issue, where is the action? The true measure of
values is not on the incessant issuing of statements but in the sum of actions
taken.
Why do you draw a false dichotomy between a crushing symbolic moment and
supporting a friend? I've had friends with serious problems and the way I support
them is by helping them be a better person - not throwing them a kegger when
they make bail.
This isn't even about politics. We can all agree that women's rights are important,
leaders serving women's rights are important, and that you invite scrutiny into
your private life when you make it public yes? What giant failure of reasoning am I
making here?

I think Joe's notice for subsequent events is likely to be after the townhall.
Note that the supreme court confirmation vote became an almost certainty
few hours after the townhall
