> Brett and his family got death threats too. That doesn't help your position
at all.
Did he have to move?

She has had to move out of her home because of death
threats! Your statements are ignorant and misguided.

And Kavanaugh likely needed security because of death
threats. For his wife. Which you will continue to ignore because it suits you.
If you are unwilling or unable to see and understand perspectives that half
of the country holds on these issues, I don't think that bodes well for the
future of the company.

You've literally built up and extremely
emotion partisan argument, step-by-step, with the end conclusion that
Brett Kavanaugh is unquestionably guilty and that Joel Kaplan's support for
him is thus tantamount to support for sexual assault. I don't think that is a
remotely reasonable position given the evidence of the case. Period.
