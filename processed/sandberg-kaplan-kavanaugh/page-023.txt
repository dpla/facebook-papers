a motto you can hear quite often (a few times in the comments to
this pose) is that "not taking sides is not an option." Either one publicly
supports one side, or by default, they are accused of supporting another
side, representing all the horrible (in the eyes of accuser) things in the
world.
I definitely count this as forcing people into debate.

Thanks for your responses. And also thanks to the people who messaged
me privately because they didn't feel comfortable posting here.
I hope not. There are lot of more noisy notifications everyday that no
one complains about.
> I also think your sentiment of "oh you can just scroll through" is a little bit
insulting
I think it's pretty clear from my post that this does not represent my
sentiment. I was asking this as a question why the people who would rather
not even have these posts on workplace at all don't consider this as an
alternative, which you responded to.
Can you guys elaborate on why you feel lack of participation
is associated with apathy? I'm asking this because I feel like the large
majority of people at Facebook do not participate in these posts (some
because they do not consider this a safe place like you mentioned), and I
think it will be impractical to label every single one who didn't participate as
apathetic.
One of the people that messaged me privately said these posts trigger
painful memories that she would like to avoid and acknowledged her
privilege in being able to do so. I understand this and see this as a good
reason why someone may not want to see these posts on workplace.
