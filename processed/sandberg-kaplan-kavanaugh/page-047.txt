Take politics out of it and consider the following thought experiment...
Many of us have really good friends working in the tech industry. There are
times when these friends are struggling in their jobs, to the point where
their career and family is hurting. Now you have skills that can help them.
What would be ok help vs not ok help? We could agree that meeting the
friend for coffee to talk would probably be fine, but writing code for them
would cross a line (or writing a legal brief, or pr script, etc). There are lines
where helping the friend actually becomes a conflict of interest and hurts
fb.
Now i'd argue that the hearing and confirmation are public government
events so i'm not sure how having fb head of government there can possibly
be seen as a private personal desicion any more then me writing code for a
friend at another company could be seen as a personal private desicion
(even if i was on pto)

These are the kinds of events that make or break a person/company. When
there's such a gap between perspectives, there's no way you can make
everybody happy. You have to pick your side and move on. The management has
exactly done that.

Hi!, I think this is just a matter of which are your starting point. Not everyone has
the same and we need to respect that.
If a person has a split between personal and professional life. We need to respect
it. I believe no one owe anything to a company as working for someone should not
constrain your freedom of opinion/going to an event/celebrate, in your personal
life - as long as it is not illegal.
Dennle cannot like it but you need to respect it. If not, you are basically forcing
