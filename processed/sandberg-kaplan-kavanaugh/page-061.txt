sure! My hang up is that, while I understand and hear all the
reasons evidence is not as afforded in instances of sexual assault, I still
believe strongly in the idea innocence until proven guilty (we agree there for
sure)
It's hard for me to balance belief in those I know stand to have nothing to
gain (let's take this case aside for a moment and think more broadly where
a
I'm sure there are clear examples) BUT with the need for evidence.
As mentioned, I've seen places where that innocence until proven guilty is
not an embedded pillar on society and corruption and injustice is
uncontrollable.

oh no, I'm engaging so heavily in these conversations
because I feel i've seen many direct and indirect challenges to that concept
which makes me feel a bit uneasy (based on what I've witnessed where it
isn't a central pillar)
Again I want to make clear for anyone reading that I understand the many
complexities of why we won't always have the evidence we'd be happy with
- but thus the problem.

I don't see this as tricky. If you find it hard to imagine someone
excommunicating a family member, I envy you. Having to deal with
psychopath relatives is not an experience I'd wish on anyone.
