She's on the cover of Time Magazine, received half a
million dollars through GoFundMe, and had a chance to block a conservative
Supreme Court appointment that is currently one of the most hated figures
on the left, even before the accusations came out.
I don't believe her testimony was motivated by any of this, but some people
do. To claim she had nothing at all to gain is disingenuous.
I'm suggesting you are biased to the point that you can't assess the
situation objectively.

Also, are you trying to imply that you're not biased? Your positions have
been consistently right-leaning (or libertarian?).

Brett and his family got death threats too. That doesn't
help your position at all.

Of course I come in with my own biases, for sure. That doesn't change how
heavily biased you are, and how political thinking takes those biases and
overwhelms objective thinking. Unless you believe that your emotions and
political beliefs conveniently are more reflective of reality.
On another note, being right of you does not make me right-leaning. I'm a
moderate.
