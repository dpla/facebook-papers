"sorry no" is just saying sorry but I disagree. Saying I'm appalled
is voicing my reaction to this viewpoint. Saying someone is "exercising
extreme privilege" in having a certain viewpoint is a direct attack on one's
character. There's a clear difference.

Calling out privilege is not a character attack. As a white
woman, I have privilege coming out of my ears, will freely admit that, and
appreciate when people call out moments where I am blind to my own
privilege, which are many.

are you saying "sorry, no" to the idea that I or the original
poster can show up at work and choose not to be Black? Or are you saying
that I or the original poster are ungrateful for the privilege of working at
Facebook? Asking for clarification here.

I'll admit that I am privileged too. I'm Male, Asian, and was given incredible
opportunities to come here to work and develop my technical skills, being a
foreigner. And, for the record, I absolutely acknowledge that systematic
racism and gender discrimination exists.
I however think it's a direct attack when I see posts like that where people
say that deciding to put my focus on work is my "privilege in action". And as
alluded to in Sheryl's post, many people feel this way. I ask that in your zeal
to speak out for the issues you face, you also empathize with others as they
seek to put their best foot forward at work, and not dismiss their viewpoint
as coming from a position of privilege. That is all.

I meant that completely dismissing the original posters'
viewpoints or feeling that being called "privileged" is an equivalent hardship
on any level is privilege in action.
