The big money is in the status quo - I bet most respected climate
scientists could make way more money as deniers in the oil and gas
industry if they had no conscience.

Is there something wrong with us having an open platform where
people can post arguments for either side of an issue and then people
make up their own minds for themselves?
This is the issue being highlighted - the side of climate change denial is
presenting their argument using misinformation. If people make up their
minds based on this misinformation, then they've been manipulated into a
potentially incorrect decision.
As an Environmental Program Manager, can you explain why you've
repeatedly sided with climate change denial in this group?

I don't appreciate the attack towards me and the
work that I do here because you don't like my viewpoint. Nor do I feel
the need to answer your question that implies something that simply
isn't true.
Please take your attacks elsewhere because you've now created an
unsafe space for open discourse here.

It doesnt really read as an attack, and it's a valid
question asked in a neutral way. Certainly you don't have to answer
anything you don't feel comfortable with but claiming this is now an
unsafe space as a result seems disingenuous. Your job title raises
more eyebrows of scrutiny the same way mine might if I sided with
groups claiming 5g causes coronavirus.

I'm not going to respond to loaded questions with false accusations. And it's
an attack on me as it's clearly trying to target my job and position in this
company because someone doesn't like my viewpoint.
It's unwarranted, unappreciated, and unsafe for me to continue the
discussion which seemed fine until Ladded that to the end of his
