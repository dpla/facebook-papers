Personally, I would like an answer to this and as a sales person on the front lines
with Microsoft, I am also being asked about this by my clients. What happened in
this particular case and in other climate related reversals? What is the point of
having independent fact checkers if we intervene?

This is pretty scary, honestly:
Policy Outreach: Our stakeholders view this content as opinion and a debate
within the scientific community, both relying on separate facts and research
conducted by scientists, therefore view the fact-check as being biased.
As the article points out, who exactly are these stakeholders? At the very least,
that's something we should be able to have an answer to internally.

Additionally, what debate in the scientific community?
"The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared
by 90%-100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent
studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the
97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based
on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on
the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N
= 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus."
