Anthropogenic climate change is causing real harm, and beliefs to the
contrary perpetuate it, increasing harm further because it discourages
the large scale action we need by politicians who listen to the people,
however misinformed their opinions.
There is a discussion to be had, but if a third party fact checker says
something is wrong or misleading, we need to take action, and there is
nothing wrong with pointing folks to high quality information, like we
do with voting.

The third party fact checker for that article was by people that do
climate change work for a living. While they have good experience
maybe, they also have a conflict of interest in that they make their
livings arguing the opposite viewpoint.
If anthropomorphic climate change is doing real harm then should we
ban or censor all who engage in it? Should we cut out advertising for
the major corporations that contribute to it since they are doing
significant physical harm to people?
I'm not arguing the effects of climate change. I simply think that an
open forum for discussion allows for education on the matter. And that
you educate, not censor, to create real, lasting, and meaningful
change in people and society.

Climate scientists are the experts on the science and best suited to
fact check it. Just like epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts
are best suited to evaluate data about coronavirus.
If scientists and fact checkers end up politicized, the mistakes will be
public and they will eventually lose their authority, just like the doctors
who were paid off to claim smoking didn't cause cancer, and leaded
gas wasn't a health problem - very damaging misinformation
campaigns that should have been shut down much earlier.

The big money is in the status quo - I bet most respected climate
scientists could make way more money as deniers in the oil and gas
industry if they had no conscience.
