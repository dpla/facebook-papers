What The F****! Are we not seeing in real time the impact of letting science mis-
information ravage our country? Our Fact Checking systems mean nothing if they
can just be overruled.

This is incredibly frustrating to read and puts me into a really awkward position
where I have to side with leakers. Since we still haven't got an internal response
about the last incident, it appears that the pressure from the outside is indeed the
only way to get an answer or drive any meaningful change.

Personally, I would like an answer to this and as a sales person on the front lines
with Microsoft, I am also being asked about this by my clients. What happened in
this particular case and in other climate related reversals? What is the point of
having independent fact checkers if we intervene?
