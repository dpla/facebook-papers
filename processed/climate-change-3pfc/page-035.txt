I don't understand why we're making this claim, unless we're being very cute and

which is allowing climate change deniers to promote their content on our
platform unchecked - this is not accurate.
Of course there's an opinion loophole for climate change denial. We've
acknowledged this fact by not having the same loophole for COVID-19

We've even defended the distinction as recently as last week by saying that
climate change misinformation does not pose "an immediate threat to human
