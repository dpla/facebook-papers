respectful workplace orders for criticizing (in what was a
misunderstanding but I was still surprised)..
Mark doesn't think people's past jobs or personal believes could ever
interfere with their ability to do their jobs. To me, everything makes
complete sense when I look at the political alignment and past jobs of
our policy makers. Everything is working as designed.

Is this true?? If so, what is our explanation?? "Internal Facebook documents
obtained by Popular Information reveal that, prior to the removal of the fact-
check, Science Feedback's fact-check of The Daily Wire article was brought to
the attention of top Facebook executives including VP of Global Affairs and
Communications Nick Clegg, VP of Global News Partnerships Campbell Brown,
and VP of Global Public Policy Joel Kaplan. The documents also show that
Facebook was asked by Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA), a powerful member
of Republican leadership, to reverse the fact-check."

What The F****! Are we not seeing in real time the impact of letting science mis-
information ravage our country? Our Fact Checking systems mean nothing if they
can just be overruled.

REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
This is incredibly frustrating to read and puts me into a really awkward position
where I have to side with leakers. Since we still haven't got an internal response
about the last incident, it appears that the pressure from the outside is indeed the
only way to get an answer or drive any meaningful change.
