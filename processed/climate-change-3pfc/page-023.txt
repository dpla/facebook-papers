On top of asking if Opinion articles are now exempt from fact checking, the
question should also ask why we don't apply the rule equally over all pages.
We had a fact checker flag an article as "Partly False" but depending on
where it was published from not all posts on FB have the flag. It seems
we've whitelisted the Daily Wire source but not others, despite the fact
checker mentioning that the article has been posted to the Daily Wire.
Examples of with the flag:

Judd was reacting to an NYT story from yesterday which got some key facts
wrong. We issued a follow up statement to clarify and I connected with Judd last
a
night to walk him through our policies. Opinion content like op-eds and editorials
are not categorically exempt from fact-checking and our fact-checkers use their
judgement to assess what qualifies based on our guidelines. We're working to
make our guidelines clearer on this going forward. You can see my response to his
tweets here. https://twitter.com/Liz_Shepherd/status/1283192105465085953

Thanks, I'm curious about Facebook intervening, rather than having the
writer appeal to the fact-checker -- do you have a response to that claim?
