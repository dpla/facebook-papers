Thank you for this update. Is it possible to get externally facing version of these
comms? My clients at Microsoft have asked about these articles in the past and
we would like to address it with them preemptively.

Our stakeholders view this content as opinion and a debate within the
scientific community, both relying on separate facts and research conducted
by scientists, therefore view the fact-check as being biased. We have also
received incoming from Representative Mike Johnson's office questioning
why it is not opinion.
This language coming from our Policy team is concerning to me. Do we as a
company view some fact-checks as potentially biased?

Also, if the idea behind 3PFC is to outsource discussions about truth, why
are we engaging with anyone* about their views on accuracy fact checks,
as opposed to redirecting any concerns to the 3PFC partner?
