What was made clear in the note, even though Judd did not cite it in
his story, is that fact-checkers have discretion on what and how to rate
and that appeals processes are run independent from us.
can you clarify how this was made clear in the note? If the
rating and appeals process is truly run independently, why was it even an
option to ask Science Feedback to amend the rating?

think the best faith interpretation would be that we
don't ask for amendments of ratings, and the comment there was
explaining why it would be a risk to make an exception here.

I'd find that more convincing if we didn't have a track record
of making exceptions, which was admitted to in the very same
sentence where the risk was discussed:
[G]iven the current press cycle around our intervention in a
Washington Examiner op-ed, and questions around whether we
exempt climate-related content from being fact-checked, we
think it would be a risk to reach out to Science Feedback and ask
a
them to amend this rating.
