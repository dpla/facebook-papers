When The Daily Wire added a link to the fact-check from their article,
Science Feedback decided to remove its Partly False rating.
Is this really sufficient for a fact checker to remove the "Partly False" rating? If the
majority of the article is still false information, a large number of people are still
going to be misled.

Science Feedback seemed to do it begrudgingly according
to their statement in the article.

The article reported that the link to the fact-check was behind a paywall. Is
that true?

I think that is correct. Non-paying users could not see the link

which makes
question - "is this
sufficient to remove a fact-check?" - even more salient.
