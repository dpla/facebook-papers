Opinion based pieces "may be" eligible for rating, yet, from the same document,
"opinion content is generally not eligible to be rated." The language
demonstrating the opinion loophole is much stronger and is presented as the

loophole in specific cases, but more generally the policy as written and as
enforced does have such a loophole?
