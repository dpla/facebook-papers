I have already been sent this article a few times by former academic colleagues
who work on climate change misinfo. They are livid.

+1. But what can we do about it?

well, I have ideas, but this seems like an outcome of
the processes of the Policy team. I will say that processes are only so
good as how transparent and consistent they are, or they cease to be
rules and turn into ad hoc decisions.
For disclosure, I am married to one of those climate change misinfo
academics and got a lot of side-eye this morning.

I agree. But Facebook and Mark do not seem to share
this concern and are not interested in employee feedback about the
policies or the Policy team. I've even been flagged under the
respectful workplace orders for criticizing (in what was a
misunderstanding but I was still surprised).
Mark doesn't think people's past jobs or personal believes could ever
interfere with their ability to do their jobs. To me, everything makes
complete sense when I look at the political alignment and past jobs of
our policy makers. Everything is working as designed.
