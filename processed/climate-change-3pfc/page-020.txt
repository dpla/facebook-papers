Thats a straw man argument comparing two very different professions.
One demands an understanding of precise methodologies and
knowledge of prior research and the other does not.
My point is he can have his opinion but his opinion doesn't make it a
debate among scientists as he is not one. Just like he can have an
opinion on COVID but his opinion would not make it a debate among
virologists (and we'd remove it for harmful misinformation)

Also, while not every software engineer has a degree in software
engineering, we wouldn't consider them a software engineer if they
weren't actually doing software engineering work and have that
experience.

Yes, software engineering does indeed demand an
understanding or precise methodologies and knowledge of prior
research - we spend a lot of time on this in school. But actually, so
does science.
Neither field requires credentials. The opinions of commentators in
either field are worthwhile based only on the level of relevant
knowledge and skill which inform the opinions. Whether the persons'
backgrounds conform to the expectations of gatekeepers (e.g. having
no formal education in the subject) is immaterial except as a quick-
and-dirty means of taking a first guess at their level of relevant
knowledge and skill.
