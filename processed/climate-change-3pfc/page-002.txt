limate change misinformation"
Facebook knows how to take action against misinformation. When COVID-19 denial took hold
on the platform, it was forcibly shut down because Facebook understood that the spread of
COVID-19 misinformation could cause imminent physical harm to the health and well-being of
Facebook users. Climate denial and misinformation are also deadly. By allowing climate
misinformation to go unchecked, Facebook is actively putting the health and well-being of our
nation's most vulnerable low-income communities and communities of color at risk.
You and the Oversight Board must step in and enact the same standard for the denial of
climate change as you did for COVID-19 misinformation.
The integrity of the Oversight Board is at risk. Mark Zuckerberg has refused to recognize that
he must get the facts right on climate, and refused to acknowledge that climate denial on his
platform is as dangerous a threat to future generations as any.
We are asking you to lead the charge to fix this. Until Facebook takes a stand, climate denial
groups such as the CO2 Coalition will continue to exploit your platform to sow discord and put
our nation's health and security at dire risk.
When you were Prime Minister, you knew for certain that climate change was fact, not opinion,
and needs to be treated as such. In your current role as an overseer of Facebook's dangerous
misinformation practice, our plea is grave: please, Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, take action now.
