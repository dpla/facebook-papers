We never got an internal explanation about what happened with this, right?

Not any that I can find, and this article seems to be the first that names all
involved parties.

Since all related tasks are private, my questions for comms are:
• Did we reach out to Science Feedback and ask them to revisit their fact
check rating?
• If not, did we reach out to Science Feedback and 'remind' them of our
policies shortly before they removed the fact check label?
• If not, did we remove the fact check label on the Daily Wire article internally?
Or did Science Feedback remove the label with no intervention from FB
whatsoever, both direct and indirect?

Third question is the most important. Article says:
Facebook and the executive director of Science Feedback deny that
Facebook pushed Science Feedback to remove the "partly false"
rating
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
So it doesn't sound like the 3PFC removed it.

I have already been sent this article a few times by former academic colleagues
who work on climate change misinfo. They are livid.
