Here is a recent example from last week of a fact-check being biased:
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blm-terrorist-rosenberg/
The explanation in the abstract boils down to the claim that the word
"terrorism" has no fixed meaning, and therefore that the claim being
checked is mixed between true and false, which is nonsense.
If Snopes wanted to split hairs, it could argue: the organizations in question
were insurrectionist in nature, but not terrorist, and that there is a distinction
to be made between these categories. Or it could argue: the organization
was terrorist in nature, but the individual was never individually convicted of
terrorism, only of other crimes in service to a terrorist organization. Or it
could argue: the individual was a terrorist and was also convicted, but was
never convicted of terrorism. Or it could argue: the terrorism thing is long in
the past and the individual today is vastly different from the individual then,
and has since renounced political violence.
However, the last paragraph of the fact-check is: "As such, a supportable
(though not definitive) case exists for claiming that the crimes of which
[she] was convicted [...] were indeed acts of domestic terrorism."
So the fact-check abstract is: that words don't have meanings, and
therefore the claim being checked should be rated as mixed between true
and false. And the fact-check conclusion is: that a claim was made which
Snopes believes to be supportable but not definitive, and therefore the
claim should be rated as mixed between true and false.
