It doesnt really read as an attack, and it's a valid
question asked in a neutral way. Certainly you don't have to answer
anything you don't feel comfortable with but claiming this is now an
unsafe space as a result seems disingenuous. Your job title raises
more eyebrows of scrutiny the same way mine might if I sided with
groups claiming 5g causes coronavirus.

I'm not going to respond to loaded questions with false accusations. And it's
an attack on me as it's clearly trying to target my job and position in this
company because someone doesn't like my viewpoint.
It's unwarranted, unappreciated, and unsafe for me to continue the
discussion, which seemed fine until
added that to the end of his
comment.

It looks like a climate change fact check was removed under exec pressure. Contains leaked
tasks/email data.
