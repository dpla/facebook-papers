Judd was reacting to an NYT story from yesterday which got some key facts
wrong. We issued a follow up statement to clarify and I connected with Judd last
night to walk him through our policies. Opinion content like op-eds and editorials
are not categorically exempt from fact-checking and our fact-checkers use their
judgement to assess what qualifies based on our guidelines. We're working to
make our guidelines clearer on this going forward. You can see my response to his
tweets here. https://twitter.com/Liz_Shepherd/status/1283192105465085953

Thanks I'm curious about Facebook intervening, rather than having the
writer appeal to the fact-checker -- do you have a response to that claim?

So, per the careful use of "categorically exempt" -- there are (non-
politician) cases where opinion pieces are exempted?
