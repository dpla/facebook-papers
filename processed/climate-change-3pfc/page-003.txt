Is there something wrong with us having an open platform where people can post
arguments for either side of an issue and then people make up their own minds
for themselves?
If there's a group that wants to post the earth is flat, should they not be allowed
to? If people want to post about the story of creation from the Old Testament,
should it be censored because science says evolution occurred otherwise? The
list could go on and on...

Not if false information gets out of control and causes significant harm.

false is relative when everyone cherry picks their
numbers. And having/espousing a different view on climate change is
not causing significant physical harm.

REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Anthropogenic climate change is causing real harm, and beliefs to the
contrary perpetuate it, increasing harm further because it discourages
the large scale action we need by politicians who listen to the people,
however misinformed their opinions.
There is a discussion to be had, but if a third party fact checker says
something is wrong or misleading, we need to take action, and there is
nothing wrong with pointing folks to high quality information, like we
do with voting.
