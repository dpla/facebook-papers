On top of asking if Opinion articles are now exempt from fact checking, the
question should also ask why we don't apply the rule equally over all pages.
We had a fact checker flag an article as "Partly False" but depending on
where it was published from not all posts on FB have the flag. It seems
we've whitelisted the Daily Wire source but not others, despite the fact
checker mentioning that the article has been posted to the Daily Wire.
Examples of with the flag:
