The comms playbook seems to lean heavily on making very specific,
semantically-precise claims that "explain" why critics are wrong and why
Facebook's entirely-blameless conduct is just being misunderstood.

That's honestly not obvious to me (and even less obvious when
we're talking about vaccine misinformation, the other category where we
take a harder line than climate). According to the same kind of global
experts we defer to on COVID-19 and vaccines, climate change is already
causing harm today, so the threat is immediate from that perspective.
If the argument is that it's not immediate because today's harm is caused by
carbon that was released many years ago (and the carbon being released
today will cause harm in the future), then we get into a philosophical (but
important!) debate about what immediate means and if it's the right criteria
for taking a threat seriously. The cause of the harm (carbon emissions) is
happening immediately (now), and it immediately begins to change the
climate, and the effects are very difficult if not impossible to reverse once
set in motion. The fact that climate change is happening "slowly" from a
human perspective does not mean it's not an immediate and urgent threat.

Hey guys, check it out:
I hear that the Tobacco Institute has some experts ready to weigh in that
cigarettes dont cause cancer, and some 'stakeholders' view this as a 'debate
within the scientific community'. Does Joel Kaplan know about this? I'm sure he'll
need to weigh in.
