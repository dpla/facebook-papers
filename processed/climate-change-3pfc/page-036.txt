We've even defended the distinction as recently as last week by saying that
climate change misinformation does not pose "an immediate threat to human
health and safety." So I think the real question is: how did we arrive at that
determination?

We gave these contradictory statements to the NYT just last week:
• "All opinion content on the platform - including op-ed articles or posts
that express the views or agendas of politicians, businesses, and
nongovernmental organizations - is exempt from fact-checking. This
policy has been in place since 2016, according to said
Facebook's policy communications director."
"According to
Facebook is most concerned with flagging or
removing content that poses an immediate threat to human health and
safety, including disinformation about the coronavirus or hate speech
that incites violence. Climate change content, he said, does not fall
within that category."

How could climate change already happening everywhere, and
impacting / destroying communities already in the south (but not rich
western countries) be considered as "not a threat to human health and
safety" baffles me

I think it's obviously clear that debates around climate change do not
have the same *immediate* threat to human health and safety that
certain kinds of covid-19 misinformation do.

The comms playbook seems to lean heavily on making very specific,
semantically-precise claims that "explain" why critics are wrong and why
