DANGER OF RABBIT HOLES (FROM AN ARTICLE LINKED WITHIN)
But the Q believers I spoke with stumbled upon these incomprehensible ideas the old-
fashioned way. They say they were indoctrinated (though they don't use that term) by their
parents, other family members, and friends, or introduced to the conspiracy through word-
of-mouth, rather than via the algorithms that have received the most national attention.
But word-of-mouth alone isn't enough. The ability of people sitting at home to follow the
online rabbit holes downward is critical. Moms are seeing an ever-changing web of
trafficking conspiracy theories bounce around their circle of mom friends, like the
debunked Wayfair conspiracy theory and USPS phishing text scam. The Jeffrey Epstein
saga, a real-life case that involved an alleged sex trafficking ring and was covered by
reputable news outlets, has also served as a key gateway into QAnon.
• Word-of-mouth and algorithmic recommendations seem to have compounding risks that
we need to consider beyond evaluating our recommendations and invite system
separately?
• I saw another post discussing the need for intentional friction in Concerto so seems like
we're thinking about it already!
Lastly I think the framing of "Engagement" is a good reminder that Concerto could easily fall
into the engagement trap. Using ranking to show UC, sort comments, and recommend groups
can lead to engagement that reflect "usage that comes from one part our brains, while the
user's decision of what makes your product worth their time comes from another"
