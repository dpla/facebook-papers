These are sources of joins of gateway group members to target harmful groups after March 01.
We see GYSJ in second place here because some groups have been flagged as non_rec - but it is
still a big vector.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Is GYSJ a pathway from nudity gateway groups to other non-rec groups?
Hypothesis
â€¢ Users in gateway groups subsequently join non-rec groups because of exposure to
GYSJ recommendations
