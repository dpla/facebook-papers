Is GYSJ a pathway from nudity gateway groups to other non-rec groups?
Hypothesis
• Users in gateway groups subsequently join non-rec groups because of exposure to
GYSJ recommendations
Results
• 10.77% of users who joined one of the top 100 gateway groups (ranked by highest
gateway score) we identify, eventually joined a non-rec group through exposure to
GYSJ vs. 8.78% of those who had no exposure to GYSJ
Mitigations
• We should consider filtering out the top gateway groups from GYSJ seeds
Are gateway groups being targeted by "super-inviters"?
Hypotheses
• Super inviters (defined as those who sent > 50 invites to our collection of target
groups) constitute a big source of invitations from gateway groups
• Users who are featured in PYMI invitations join more non-rec groups
• Users in gateway groups join more non-rec groups through PYMK (friending → invites
→ join a harmful group)
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Results
• 35% of invites (-730K) to these harmful groups went to members after they joined one
of the top 100 gateway groups. Of these 730K invites, 20% came from "super-inviters"
• We did not see evidence supporting the PYMI hypothesis; roughly equal fractions of
users between control and testing in the long-term PYMI holdout eventually joined non-
rec groups.
