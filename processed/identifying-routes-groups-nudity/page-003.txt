. In addition, we believe Gateway groups can be used as (sparse) features to improve
recall of existing models. We are working with the Entity & Actor Understanding team to
evaluate models using these groups as features.
Quick refresher on Gateway groups
As part of studying pathways to harmful entities, we wanted to explore the question "Are there
groups that facilitated and increased the probability of a user joining harmful groups?" We call
such groups gateway groups as they often lead people to join harmful groups.
Here, we provide a brief overview of how we detect gateway groups. For thorough details see this
note.

To answer the question, we first build a classifier that, given a list of groups joined by an user, can
predict with high accuracy whether the user will end up joining a given target harmful group. For a
