Identifying pathways to harmful
groups about nudity
A key component of the Drebbel system is to discover pathways to harmful entities a user might
take when engaging with our recommendation surfaces. As part of this effort, we have built a
workflow to identify entities that act as gateways to recognized harmful entities. In this note, we
apply this workflow to focus on groups considered harmful due to nudity and sexual activity.
• Gateway groups for nudity/sexual activity harm seem to facilitate eventual connections
to non-rec Groups. We should consider interventions that are either targeted towards
users in these gateway groups, or at the entity-level in order to prevent these
downstream connections from happening.
• Specific interventions we propose include: GYSJ seed filtering, invite friction and entity-
level demotion. We are working with the Deamplification team to pursue experiments
both at entity-level and at the edge-level.
• We should stress however, that not all gateway groups are potentially problematic in
and of themselves; we should use other signals of harm (e.g., number of members
flagged as non-rec, group demotion score etc.) in conjunction to determine the ones
that we want to consider enforcing on more aggressively.
. In addition, we believe Gateway groups can be used as (sparse) features to improve
recall of existing models. We are working with the Entity & Actor Understanding team to
evaluate models using these groups as features.

Quick refresher on Gateway groups
As part of studying pathways to harmful entities, we wanted to explore the question "Are there
groups that facilitated and increased the probability of a user joining harmful groups?" We call
such groups gateway groups as they often lead people to join harmful groups.
Here, we provide a brief overview of how we detect gateway groups. For thorough details see this
note.

To answer the question, we first build a classifier that, given a list of groups joined by an user, can
predict with high accuracy whether the user will end up joining a given target harmful group. For a
particular user, after every group they join, we evaluate the probability of them joining a harmful
group in the future. If this probability spikes after a group join, that is a sign that the group just
joined might be a gateway. If this spike happens for multiple users, after joining the same group,
we identify it as a gateway group.
For this note, we used as the set of target groups those based in US with at least 60 content-level
strikes for nudity and sexual activity in the month of March (source table:
eau_nudity_sexual activity_strike_harm_source: integrity).

These are sources of joins of gateway group members to target harmful groups after March 01.
We see GYSJ in second place here because some groups have been flagged as non_rec - but it is
still a big vector.
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Is GYSJ a pathway from nudity gateway groups to other non-rec groups?
Hypothesis
• Users in gateway groups subsequently join non-rec groups because of exposure to
GYSJ recommendations

Is GYSJ a pathway from nudity gateway groups to other non-rec groups?
Hypothesis
• Users in gateway groups subsequently join non-rec groups because of exposure to
GYSJ recommendations
Results
• 10.77% of users who joined one of the top 100 gateway groups (ranked by highest
gateway score) we identify, eventually joined a non-rec group through exposure to
GYSJ vs. 8.78% of those who had no exposure to GYSJ
Mitigations
• We should consider filtering out the top gateway groups from GYSJ seeds
Are gateway groups being targeted by "super-inviters"?
Hypotheses
• Super inviters (defined as those who sent > 50 invites to our collection of target
groups) constitute a big source of invitations from gateway groups
• Users who are featured in PYMI invitations join more non-rec groups
• Users in gateway groups join more non-rec groups through PYMK (friending → invites
→ join a harmful group)
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
Results
• 35% of invites (-730K) to these harmful groups went to members after they joined one
of the top 100 gateway groups. Of these 730K invites, 20% came from "super-inviters"
• We did not see evidence supporting the PYMI hypothesis; roughly equal fractions of
users between control and testing in the long-term PYMI holdout eventually joined non-
rec groups.

• We did not see evidence supporting the PYMI hypothesis; roughly equal fractions of
users between control and testing in the long-term PYMI holdout eventually joined non-
rec groups.
• We also did not see enough evidence to suggest that PYMK influences connections to
harmful groups either through featuring more users as candidates or showing them
more friend recommendations
Mitigations
• Introduce feature limits on super-inviters, e.g., number of bulk invites that can be sent
out by super-inviters. We can make this more targeted by focusing only on invites going
out to users in a gateway group but this is a more intrusive enforcement and would
require more thought about how we communicate this intervention to the actor.
Correlation with Non-rec groups
Hypotheses
• Gateway groups are themselves good predictors of non-rec groups
Results
REDACTED FOR CONGRESS
• Out of the top 100 gateway groups for the nudity harm target list, 47 are correctly
labeled non-rec; importantly, 42 of these were labeled as non-rec after the workflow
ran. Although the model is not intended for predicting overall non-rec signal (the model
is trained on a specific subset of harm strikes - nudity & sexual activity - and so
would miss out on groups determined non-rec for other harms), this is nonetheless a
strong indicator of how important the model could be as a signal upstream.

Mitigations
• We should use gateway groups as a (sparse) feature powering our entity models for
determining non-amplifiable and non-rec entities.
• In conjunction with other signals, such as content strike roll-ups, number of non-rec
members, entity strikes, we can pursue entity-level demotions. Our signal has high
correlation with the number of group members considered non-rec and has positive
correlation with other signals such as strikes and the CPI non-amplifiable flag.

In addition, we believe
Gateway groups can be used
as (sparse) features to
improve recall of existing
models. We are working with
the Entity & Actor
Understanding team to
evaluate models using these
groups as features.
From an ads perspective this might
be an interesting feature to identify
advertisers, business, or other
commercial entities that might be
worth enforcing against.

We are already using it to find

looking for other areas to
apply this workflow on and
would be great to collaborate!
