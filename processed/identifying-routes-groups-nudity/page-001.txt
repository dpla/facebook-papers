Identifying pathways to harmful
groups about nudity
A key component of the Drebbel system is to discover pathways to harmful entities a user might
take when engaging with our recommendation surfaces. As part of this effort, we have built a
workflow to identify entities that act as gateways to recognized harmful entities. In this note, we
apply this workflow to focus on groups considered harmful due to nudity and sexual activity.
• Gateway groups for nudity/sexual activity harm seem to facilitate eventual connections
to non-rec Groups. We should consider interventions that are either targeted towards
users in these gateway groups, or at the entity-level in order to prevent these
downstream connections from happening.
• Specific interventions we propose include: GYSJ seed filtering, invite friction and entity-
level demotion. We are working with the Deamplification team to pursue experiments
both at entity-level and at the edge-level.
• We should stress however, that not all gateway groups are potentially problematic in
and of themselves; we should use other signals of harm (e.g., number of members
flagged as non-rec, group demotion score etc.) in conjunction to determine the ones
that we want to consider enforcing on more aggressively.
. In addition, we believe Gateway groups can be used as (sparse) features to improve
recall of existing models. We are working with the Entity & Actor Understanding team to
evaluate models using these groups as features.

Sur internet connection was restored.
thways to harmful entities, we wanted to explore the question "Are there
groups that memacu and increased the probability of a user joining harmful groups?" We call
