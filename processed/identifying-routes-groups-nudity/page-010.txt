Results
• Out of the top 100 gateway groups for the nudity harm target list, 47 are correctly
labeled non-rec; importantly, 42 of these were labeled as non-rec after the workflow
ran. Although the model is not intended for predicting overall non-rec signal (the model
is trained on a specific subset of harm strikes - nudity & sexual activity - and so
would miss out on groups determined non-rec for other harms), this is nonetheless a
strong indicator of how important the model could be as a signal upstream.
Mitigations
• We should use gateway groups as a (sparse) feature powering our entity models for
determining non-amplifiable and non-rec entities.
• In conjunction with other signals, such as content strike roll-ups, number of non-rec
members, entity strikes, we can pursue entity-level demotions. Our signal has high
correlation with the number of group members considered non-rec and has positive
correlation with other signals such as strikes and the CPI non-amplifiable flag.
