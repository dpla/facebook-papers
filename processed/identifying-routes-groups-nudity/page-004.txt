To answer the question, we first build a classifier that, given a list of groups joined by an user, can
predict with high accuracy whether the user will end up joining a given target harmful group. For a
particular user, after every group they join, we evaluate the probability of them joining a harmful
group in the future. If this probability spikes after a group join, that is a sign that the group just
joined might be a gateway. If this spike happens for multiple users, after joining the same group,
we identify it as a gateway group.
For this note, we used as the set of target groups those based in US with at least 60 content-level
strikes for nudity and sexual activity in the month of March (source table:
eau_nudity_sexual activity_strike_harm_source: integrity).
What pathways lead from gateway groups to harmful nudity groups?
