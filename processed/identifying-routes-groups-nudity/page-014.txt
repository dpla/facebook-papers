thanks for the tag.
are you already connected
with business integrity (BI)?
Within BI, you probably want
to talk to 2 groups:
1. enforcement folks (1
assume we also have rules
against nudity in ads)
2. actor level enforcement
(PM
). If
there are ad accounts,
advertisers etc. that you've
identified are problematic.
Additionally, you might find
some pages integrity folks
helpful, I'm not sure who is
the right person but start with
Jan Kodovsky if you aren't
already in contact with them.

This is super interesting, how
transferable is this approach to
other areas with gateway groups?
Wondering if we can leverage this
approach for violence cc
