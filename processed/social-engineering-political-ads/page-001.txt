A core team of dedicated product, engineering, and design Facebookers are tackling the most
glaring problems with what happened: increasing verification procedures for US political
advertisers, exposing the funding source of political ads, making active ads available
regardless of targeting, and publicly archiving political ads as they run. We are taking initial
steps to prioritize civility above other objectives in this space, but we can go even further-
use the existing framework for how our ads system works to empower people with
information:
1) Allow political education and campaign
funders to more clearly self-declare their
financial support for specific messages.
Version 1 of our political ad rendering has advertisers enter a â€œpaid for by" on individual ads
run by individual ad accounts. From our research thus far, most of the advertisers in this
space are worried less about being identified with their strongly-held views and more about
unintentionally running afoul of the law. How do we let organizations more visibly and
consistently self-identify as campaign or independent expenditure organizations across
entire campaigns or elections, and do so at the ad set, ad campaign or business level?
