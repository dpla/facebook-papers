Advertising should be safe and
civil; it should not divide or
discriminate.
At the same time, polarization is an important marketing strategy made manifest in the
creative, messaging, and targeting of ads. We don't want to discourage segmentation
strategies on the part of our advertisers as a whole, which for many small and medium-sized
businesses starting with a particular niche is a prerequisite for entering growth mode.
We have to countenance these two realities in Business Integrity. We enforce ad policies for
the sake of Facebook and it's users, while doing our best to at least provide and at best
enhance advertiser value. However, we've recently come into an intense amount of scrutiny
for the lack of specific policies about political ads from both regulators and Facebook users.

Many articles have discussed how was how Russian online influence in US elections worked
at least back in 2016 if not earlier: the use of influence operations." At its core, this was an
abuse of the openness our our platform, on both the organic and Ads side, in order to divide
and undermine confidence in the election process and American civil society more broadly.
