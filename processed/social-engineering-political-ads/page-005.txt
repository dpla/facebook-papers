3) Start a recurring political ads
transparency report to hold ourselves
accountable to the public, including product
launches and global performance.
The largest part of Facebook's optics problem with political ads is the lack of public and
regulatory awareness of proactive and reactive efforts taking place at the company. We can
and should highlight major victories in political ad enforcement, good actors making our
platform better and ongoing efforts we're committed to bringing online. We have a
transparency report- https://transparency.facebook.com/government/ --for exposing the
number of takedown requests we get from governments around the world, why not begin
offering a public-facing, clear and sincere update on where we've succeeded and where we
have to grow with political ads transparency?
